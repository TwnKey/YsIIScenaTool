The horns which grow from
its head are proof of its
noble descent from dragons.
Can cleave a man in twain
with its mighty tail.";"";"";
2e20f;"Found in the Central Shrine.
A tough, four-armed monster
with bright blue skin. Its
crimson claws can cut down
any intruder, leaving not a
moment to counterattack.";"";"";
2e2b9;"A Bearot elite. Demands to
be referred to by its given
title, 'Master,' and brings
down its wrath upon any
who dare refuse this simple
request.";"";"";
2e34f;"Looks like a brutish human,
but with tough skin. Wields
a hatchet-like blade. The
expression on its alligator-
like face betrays its lust
for slaughter.";"";"";
2e3ef;"A lizardman well-versed in
the lore of demons after 100
years of study. Wears a
bluish robe and carries a
staff, from which it fires
painful blasts of energy.";"";"";
2e495;"A heavily-armored warrior
witch who serves as body-
guard to Zava. Uses its
mastery of swordplay to
chop its victims to pieces.
Found in the royal chambers.";"";"";
2e539;"A Bearot noble who guards
the gates of Solomon Shrine.
Undefeated in battle. Its
kind has been dubbed the
'Blazing Madmen,' and it
does live up to that name.";"";"";
2e5dd;"Appears as a beautiful young
woman, but is actually a
loyal follower of Zava,
intent upon dealing death.
A favorite of Zava's due to
its unmatched abilities.";"";"";
2e681;"A huge demon whose body is
protected from sword strikes
by a hard shell. Fires
energy from its eye to
decimate its victims. Since
physical attacks are inef-
fective, those with no magic
are doomed in its wake.";"";"";
2e759;"An ice creature with pre-
cision control over its
chosen elemental. With its
one eye and strong back legs
it can make mighty leaps to
attack from above. When it
strikes the ground, deadly
shards of ice are scattered.";"";"";
2e839;"A truly hideous beast with
the appearance of a giant's
severed head. Approaches
its prey slowly, occasion-
ally releasing an oversized
tentacle from its mouth to
block an escape route. Its
thick hide is impenetrable.";"";"";
2e919;"Looks like a giant spider,
more or less. With its four
rigid legs, it can only be
damaged from the front.
Launches countless exploding
eggs and balls of energy in
an attempt to toy with its
prey for sheer amusement.";"";"";
2e9f7;"The third most powerful of
all the demons. Commands
countless minions, and has
the appearance of a gorgeous
woman, like her attendants.
When angered, she'll flay
every last bit of flesh from
the bones of her prey.";"";"";
2ead3;"The puppetmaster with the
Cleria Cloak who commands
the demons. Born of pure
demon heritage, making him
invulnerable to magic. Only
Darm is stronger-- and Darm
is the only man Dalles
answers to.";"";"";
2eb9d;"The source of all magic and
all demons. Once guided the
land of Ys to prosperity,
but later spawned demonkind.
Some call him the devil. His
true form is the Black
Pearl-- an item housing un-
imaginable dark power.";"";"";

2f8d5;"I'm sorry to keep bothering you,
Adol, but would you go tell him?";"";"";

earlier. Someone had best let him know,
before he throws himself in it!";"";"";

statue you saw may be Sada himself.";"";"";

handle anything he finds.";"";"";

the sword which serves as our
family heirloom.";"";"";

Goddesses. Sada will be overjoyed!";"";"";

I am that she is alive and well.";"";"";
2fec7;"...";"";"";
2fed1;"It was foolish of him to enter the
Shrine on his own...but I can't really
blame him, considering the situation.";"";"";
2ff47;"If he had been here, Sada would've
given his life to protect her.";"";"";
2ff8f;"Sada was out on patrol on the day they
attacked, so he wasn't around to put up
a fight. Which he certainly would've.";"";"";
3000b;"Maria is Sada's fiancee. Three days
ago, she was taken by the demons.";"";"";
30057;"No one knows quite why, but around
six months ago, demons began pouring
out from the Shrine of Solomon.";"";"";
300c5;"We'd been living peacefully here
since Ys rose into the sky seven
hundred years ago.";"";"";
30121;"Ramia Village prospered in the shadow
of the Shrine gates.";"";"";
30163;"If we should try to fight back, they'd
raze the village to the ground without
the slightest effort. We can only hide.";"";"";
301df;"They are powerful, after all. And they
vastly outnumber us.";"";"";
30221;"We've established a lookout post in
front of the Shrine now, to give us
advance warning if the demons attack.";"";"";
30295;"If control of the Shrine were taken back
from the demons, all of Ys may be saved.
And I believe you are the man to do it!";"";"";
30315;"As I understand it, though, the true way
in is right by the Shrine's entrance...";"";"";
3036d;"It's an area of great power, and is
thus considered off-limits, and placed
under heavy guard.";"";"";
303d1;"At the heart of the Shrine is a
royal chamber wherein the twin
Goddesses once resided.";"";"";
3042f;"It's basically a giant labyrinth, and no
one knows quite how to find anything in
there. Plus, it's teeming with demons!";"";"";
304ad;"It was once a shrine to the Goddesses.
The royal chamber is near the bell
tower, and the layout is sectioned.";"";"";
30521;"Even now, I still remember it as if it
were yesterday. As dusk hit, it felt
like the sky was stained with blood...";"";"";
3059b;"Marle and her brother were both killed.
Marle's remains were found at her home,
but her brother's body was missing.";"";"";
30615;"The day the demons began attacking us,
six months ago...";"";"";
30655;"It's been half a year, but it's still a
painful memory. Two innocent people
lived in that house...and died there...";"";"";
306cf;"Ah, Adol! So glad to see you
in one piece!";"";"";
30701;"Is that the #c2#Cleria Sword#c# I see
in your hands? I assume Sada
gave it to you...";"";"";
3075d;"#c2#Adol described his meeting with
Sada to Hadat.";"";"";
30797;"Since Sada has entrusted the sword
to you, please allow me to augment
the set.";"";"";
307ed;"I see... Thank goodness...";"";"";
3080f;"Adol, I pray that your battle will
end in victory. If you need my help
with anything, do not hesitate to ask.";"";"";
30883;"Seven hundred years ago, Ys became a
sort of ark in the sky, if you will...
and we've been floating here ever since.";"";"";
308ff;"If only I had the Cleria Shield
to give you, as well...";"";"";
3093d;"That sword and armor will serve you
quite well. I'm sure of it.";"";"";
30983;"Both were entrusted to us for the sole
purpose of one day being handed down to
the hero led by the twin Goddesses.";"";"";
309fd;"This is Cleria Armor, which my family
preserved alongside the sword.";"";"";
30a49;"Is there something you needed?";"";"";
30a6f;"Old man #c2#Regg#c# might be able to
understand you, but all I hear
are adorable whimpers!";"";"";
30ad1;"Are you...Adol? I'm sorry, but I don't
speak the language of the beasts.
You'll need to approach me as a human.";"";"";
30b47;"Old man #c2#Regg#c# might be able to
understand you, but all I hear
are adorable whimpers!";"";"";
30ba9;"Yes, yes, you're very cute, Ado-roo.
But nothing will be accomplished if
I can't make out a word you're saying!";"";"";
30c1f;"Disguised as one of their own,
the beasts will surely let you
into the Shrine of Solomon!";"";"";
30c7f;"Interesting power you've got there!";"";"";
30ca9;"Hmm? You're no ordinary Roo, are you...
I see, so it's you, Adol...";"";"";
30cf3;"One of the sacred creatures appearing
before us can only be a good omen. Who's
a good omen? You are! Yes, you are!";"";"";
30d6d;"Hmm... A demon? No, far too cute for
that. You're clearly a Roo! Just about
the age for breeding, too, I'd say...";"";"";
30de5;"The legend has been silenced
for seven hundred years. But
now, the story has an end...";"";"";
30e43;"Ys has descended to the ground.";"";"";
30e69;"I guess it's important to have faith in
the power of youth. You've come so far,
there's simply no turning back now!";"";"";
30ee3;"Honestly, you, Sada and Tarf are
all the same. Reckless, careless
and headache-inducing, the lot of you!";"";"";
30f53;"I took my eyes off of him for
just one moment, and off he went!
That wily Tarf...";"";"";
30fab;"I believe that your quest will end in
victory. But if I may be of some help
along the way, it would be my pleasure.";"";"";
31025;"We have a lively young guest
waiting for you, Adol.";"";"";
3105f;"Do you need anything, Adol?";"";"";
31081;"Do you need anything, Adol?";"";"";
310a3;"Come again, anytime!";"";"";
310bf;"Can I help you with something?";"";"";
310e5;"You have the eyes of one who's
seen many things, yet always
desires to see more.";"";"";
3113d;"Ah, a traveling swordsman.";"";"";
3115f;"Mister Adol, you're toooo sloooow!
C'mon! Hurry it up, already!";"";"";
311a5;"I was being all brave and sneaky, and
followed him all the way here!";"";"";
311f1;"I saw that guy in the black cloak, just
outside the village.";"";"";
31235;"So, like, it happened right after you
left.";"";"";
31267;"It seems like the demons really have it
in for you, too, mister. You've been put
through a lot!";"";"";
312cd;"Mister Adol, I'd watch out for that guy
if I were you. He's real bad news!";"";"";

you gave me, when you got me outta
that cave?";"";"";
315b1;"...Or not...?";"";"";
315c5;"I have it right here...ish...";"";"";
315e9;"That stone was so small, too... I dunno
if I could possibly find it now. Don't
even know where I dropped it!";"";"";
3165d;"Oh, crap! There's a
hole in my pocket!";"";"";
3168b;"I'm really sorry, mister! I hope it
wasn't super-important or anything...";"";"";
316db;"I was playing around with it in my
pocket when I talked to that guy with
the funny eyes... You know, the guard?";"";"";
31751;"I had it when I got to the village, that
much I know.";"";"";
3178d;"#c2#Adol told Tarf not to worry, and
reassured him that the Black Pearl
would surely be found soon.";"";"";

You're her only hope!";"";"";

parties, thankyouverymuch!";"";"";

land! And water! Where before, there

32a63;"I see you've cleared the demons
from my basement.";"";"";
32a9b;"Your selfless, noble actions
have not gone unnoticed.";"";"";
32ad7;"I'm in your debt, good sir.";"";"";
32af9;"If you should ever need
to come back, feel free.";"";"";
32b31;"What ever shall I do?!";"";"";
32b4f;"Ohh, crap... It's those blasted demons
again! Demons in my basement-- a whole
mess of 'em!";"";"";
32bb1;"Huh? What's that...?";"";"";
32bcd;"...Uh, hey... You seem like someone
who knows his way around a sword.
You mind getting rid of 'em for me?";"";"";
32c3d;"Well? Find anything
amiss down there?";"";"";
32c69;"...Nothing? Really?!";"";"";
32c85;"Please?";"";"";
32c93;"Just...please, figure out what the
hell is happening down there!";"";"";
32cdb;"Well, consider this an open invitation
to return to my basement anytime. Lounge
around, throw parties-- whatever!";"";"";
32d53;"Aren't you that adventurer guy who
was resting up over at Banoa's?";"";"";
32d9d;"Hey, you.";"";"";
32dad;"It's been going on for a while
now, and it's driving me crazy!";"";"";
32df3;"You are? Perfect! Lately, there have
been seriously creepy noises coming
from my basement.";"";"";
32e55;"...Would you mind checking
my basement for demons?";"";"";
32e8f;"Since you're an adventurer, and
adventurers explore things...
well, I was kinda hoping...";"";"";
32eef;"#c0#No";"";"";
32efd;"#c0#Yes";"";"";
32f0b;"#c1#Investigate the basement?#c#";"";"";
32f31;"As if Ys weren't already full of enough
problems, I've got all these horrific
noises coming from my basement...";"";"";
32fa7;"So, if there's nothing you
need, then I'd ask that you
please let yourself out...";"";"";
32fff;"There's nothing I like better
than not being bothered.";"";"";
3303d;"I loathe uncivilized ruffians.";"";"";
33063;"Leave me be. If you have no business
with me, then please, just go. Don't
disturb my solitude.";"";"";
330c9;"What's up? Did you
need something?";"";"";
330f3;"There was no further indication of the
demonic presence. It seemed as if all
of the demons had been eradicated.";"";"";
33169;"Adol's chaotic surroundings
suddenly became calm and still.";"";"";
331ab;"The demons in his immediate surroundings
were vanquished, but Adol sensed more of
them in the Sanctuary beyond.";"";"";
33221;"The demons in his immediate surroundings
were vanquished, but Adol sensed more of
them back in Gila's basement.";"";"";
33297;"Excuse you?!";"";"";
332ab;"What gives you the right to
just barge into my house?!";"";"";
332e9;"It...it's a demon...!";"";"";
33305;"It seems like the clouds are higher
in the sky than they've ever been
before. How could that be?!";"";"";
3336d;"Where on Ys could our Lilia have
gotten herself off to...?";"";"";
333af;"Come to think of it, Bohtz was saying
that Lilia was nowhere to be found
after everyone was captured...";"";"";
3341d;"I'm just glad that Bohtz
got back safely.";"";"";
3344d;"Banoa's daughter, Lilia, has also
vanished. I don't like this...";"";"";
33495;"Bohtz, the miner, hasn't
been seen for a while.";"";"";
334cb;"So you're the one who brought
us the ore, are you? Thanks
muchly for your help!";"";"";
33521;"Now that he can start smithing
again, my husband's gone right
back to his old, chipper self.";"";"";
33585;"I can't bear to see
him like this...";"";"";
335b1;"My husband is an armorsmith, but he
hasn't been able to work for some time
on account of his iron ore running low.";"";"";
3362b;"Ack! Aieee!";"";"";
3363d;"With my dad here, I don't have
anything to be scared of!";"";"";
3367d;"Oookay, time to study!";"";"";
3369b;"He always looks happy when I
tell him I wanna be like him
when I grow up.";"";"";
336eb;"Heh. I've been talking to
my dad a lot about armor-
smithing lately.";"";"";
33737;"I'm really, really not sure
what to think right now...";"";"";
33775;"I want him to train me, so
I can be an armorsmith too
when I grow up!";"";"";
337c1;"Dad looks so cool when he's
making armor! He's all focused
and serious...";"";"";
33811;"I hate seeing him like that.
On numerous levels!";"";"";
33849;"All he does now is wander
the village like a loon...";"";"";
33885;"Dad's a really good armorsmith, but
he hasn't been able to make armor for
a while because he has no iron.";"";"";
338f5;"Bite me and you're dead.";"";"";
33915;"I've got special armor on.";"";"";
33937;"Nothing makes a man feel
complete like the sense
of a job well done.";"";"";
33983;"Oh, so you're the one who brought
me the Iron Ore, are you?";"";"";
339c5;"Frankly, I'm elated. I never thought
I'd have the opportunity to see a man
in full Cleria Armor standing before me.";"";"";
33a3f;"Such exquisite craftsmanship...";"";"";
33a65;"It's so shiny...and the color...
Is that...Cleria Armor?!";"";"";
33aa5;"H...hey. Your armor...";"";"";
33ac3;"Brace yourself, Adol. It's a
bumpy road ahead.";"";"";
33af9;"The task before you is a great
one, which may shake the very
foundations of Ys.";"";"";
33b4f;"A swordsman of Cleria...";"";"";
33b6f;"Of course, it's just a legend, so it
may not even be real. But if it is...
Oh, what I would give to see it!";"";"";
33be1;"It's called Cleria Armor, and is
made from a legendary metal unlike
any other.";"";"";
33c37;"By the way, have you heard about
the legendary suit of armor?
Supposedly exists somewhere in Ys...";"";"";
33ca1;"Take a look around Ys, and see
for yourself what it's like.";"";"";
33ce3;"Not everyone is as skilled with a blade
as you...and no one else dares set foot
outside the village, as you'd imagine.";"";"";
33d61;"Looks like you've been
wandering pretty far
afield.";"";"";
33d9b;"If you should happen to find any
Iron Ore, bring it to Guido. He'll
pay you a handsome sum for it!";"";"";
33e05;"...Can you even understand
what I'm saying? Do you speak
our language?";"";"";
33e53;"Go pick on someone
else next time.";"";"";
33e7d;"I've been attacked by
demons once already.";"";"";
33eaf;"Please leave me be.";"";"";
33ec9;"...Can you even understand
what I'm saying? Do you speak
our language?";"";"";
33f17;"I have a wife and two
young daughters.";"";"";
33f45;"Please, spare me.";"";"";
33f5d;"Go on, you should get back
to the village. Banoa will be
delighted to see you!";"";"";
33fb3;"Thank goodness! Where did you
go after you disappeared down
in that canal?";"";"";
34005;"Lilia's been found?!";"";"";
34021;"It's all because of you, Adol,
that I've been reunited with my
family. Thank you so very much!";"";"";
34087;"Banoa must be worried sick!";"";"";
340a9;"On that note, where did Lilia go?
Did you find her?!";"";"";
340e5;"When the demons caught me in the Shrine,
I thought I was done for. I'll have to
be more careful from now on.";"";"";
34159;"The demons down there are pretty
light on brains, so they don't
pose all that much of a threat.";"";"";
341bf;"Oh, there were demons there... That
hasn't changed. But if you stay on
your guard, they're easy to deal with.";"";"";
34233;"I was just down in the Rasteenie
Mine earlier. Hadn't been there
in quite some time.";"";"";
3428f;"I wonder if I should stock up on
weapons and armor at Guido's, and
head down into the mine...";"";"";
342f3;"I wouldn't want to worry my wife
and little girls, though...so I
guess I'll show some self-restraint.";"";"";
3435f;"I've just been itching to get back
into Rasteenie for the last little
while...";"";"";
343b5;"My wife worries about me because of all
the demons, so I've been keeping my eye
on the situation for a while now.";"";"";
3442d;"Actually, I'm going to the
mine with Flair to look
for Herbs and Iron Ore.";"";"";
3447f;"I hear you rescued Dr. Flair.
You have no idea how much we
appreciate that.";"";"";
344d1;"If there's anything
you're curious about,
feel free to ask.";"";"";
34513;"I know a bit more about
Rasteenie Mine than other
folks do.";"";"";
34555;"Hey! What the hell
are you doing?!";"";"";
3457f;"I suppose as long as my husband
is at my side, I can face whatever
this world throws at me...";"";"";
345e3;"So, Ys is back on the surface...
Now what?";"";"";
34615;"I hear you're the one who
rescued him. Words cannot
express my gratitude!";"";"";
34665;"My dear husband has returned!";"";"";
34689;"All I can do now is pray
that he's safe, wherever
he may be.";"";"";
346cd;"Oh, dear... Where could my
husband have gotten himself
off to?!";"";"";
34713;"There's a rumor going around that the
demons are kidnapping people. And I must
say, I don't much care for that rumor!";"";"";
3478f;"My husband hasn't returned
from Rasteenie Mine yet...";"";"";
347cb;"But I do still worry about him. I
mean, he is my husband, after all!";"";"";
34817;"My husband agreed not to do anything
that would put him in danger, so I gave
him my blessing to go back to his work.";"";"";
34893;"But both have been swarming
with demons lately, so the
going is...not easy!";"";"";
348e5;"It's his job to look for Herbs and
Iron Ore in the abandoned Rasteenie
Mine and the Ruins of Moondoria.";"";"";
34953;"My husband is a miner.";"";"";
34971;"Demons are scaaary...";"";"";
3498d;"Scaaary.";"";"";
3499d;"But Mom is kinda scary too...";"";"";
349c1;"Scarier!";"";"";
349d1;"So I'm scared, but less scared
than as scared as I could be
scared. Scared. I like that word!";"";"";
34a35;"So yeah. Sorry. You're less
scary than Mom.";"";"";
34a67;"How did we get back on
the surface?!";"";"";
34a93;"Land down! LAND DOWN!";"";"";
34aaf;"There's water EVERYWHERE!";"";"";
34acf;"Amaaaaazing...";"";"";
34ae5;"They call it the 'sea.'";"";"";
34b03;"...They do?";"";"";
34b15;"Let's go swimming!";"";"";
34b2f;"Let's go fishing!";"";"";
34b47;"Daddy's home!";"";"";
34b5b;"He came back!";"";"";
34b6f;"He went to the Shrine, right?";"";"";
34b93;"Oh, yeah...";"";"";
34ba5;"He didn't bring souvenirs!";"";"";
34bc7;"He's a meanie!";"";"";
34bdd;"Daddy's still not back yet...";"";"";
34c01;"I bet he's not comin'...";"";"";
34c21;"I want him back NOW!";"";"";
34c3d;"Right now!";"";"";
34c4f;"I hope he brings souvenirs!";"";"";
34c71;"Big ones!";"";"";
34c81;"Like maybe some jewels!";"";"";
34c9f;"Or money!";"";"";
34caf;"We're twiiins!";"";"";
34cc5;"Twiiins!";"";"";
34cd5;"Even our dad can't
tell us apart!";"";"";
34cfd;"Can't tell! Can't tell!";"";"";
34d1b;"Our mother can't tell
us apart, either!";"";"";
34d49;"Can't tell! Can't tell!";"";"";
34d67;"Even we can't tell
each other apart!";"";"";
34d93;"Nope! Can't tell!";"";"";
34dab;"Wait... Is that true?
We can tell each other
apart just fine, big sis!";"";"";
34df9;"No, I'm the little sis!";"";"";
34e17;"Oh, yeah, I guess you are...";"";"";
34e3b;"Demons are scaaary...";"";"";
34e57;"Scaaary.";"";"";
34e67;"But Mom is kinda scary too...";"";"";
34e8b;"Scarier!";"";"";
34e9b;"So I'm scared, but less scared
than as scared as I could be
scared. Scared. I like that word!";"";"";
34eff;"So yeah. Sorry. You're less
scary than Mom.";"";"";
34f31;"Daddy's home!";"";"";
34f45;"He came back!";"";"";
34f59;"He went to the Shrine, right?";"";"";
34f7d;"Oh, yeah...";"";"";
34f8f;"He didn't bring souvenirs!";"";"";
34fb1;"He's a meanie!";"";"";
34fc7;"Daddy's still not back yet...";"";"";
34feb;"I bet he's not comin'...";"";"";
3500b;"I want him back NOW!";"";"";
35027;"Right now!";"";"";
35039;"I hope he brings souvenirs!";"";"";

351e3;"No, I'm the little sis!";"";"";
35201;"Oh, yeah, I guess you are...";"";"";
35225;"Aiiieeeeee!";"";"";
35237;"The days have been warmer
lately, which we old folks
certainly don't mind.";"";"";
35289;"Ah, well. When you get to be my age,
sonny, you'll find you don't worry too
much about things like demons anymore!";"";"";
35303;"Seems like the demons have been
multiplying like rabbits these
days. There are just soooo many...";"";"";
3536b;"There's something about you,
lad. The Goddesses must smile
upon you.";"";"";
353b7;"It's so good of you to have
helped Lilia like you did.
Thank you so much!";"";"";
35407;"You seem like a nice young man.
You should rest and recuperate.
Maybe then it'll come to you!";"";"";
3546b;"...Oh. You don't remember?";"";"";
3548d;"Aren't you the one who was found
unconscious, in the field? Why on
Ys were you there in the first place?!";"";"";
354fd;"Beware the follies of youth, young man.
Being young means feeling like you're
invincible. But know this: You aren't.";"";"";
35579;"Aaaaaaaagggh!";"";"";
3558d;"I've never actually seen a
demon, but I'll bet they're
pretty scary.";"";"";
355d9;"I'm not afraid of any demons.
If they came into this village,
I'd show 'em what's what!";"";"";
35637;"It's such a relief to
hear that she's okay.";"";"";
35669;"It's nice to hear some good news
these days. We don't get that very
often anymore.";"";"";
356c3;"So, you're the young man who
saved Lilia's life, are you?";"";"";
35703;"Damnable demons! If it weren't
for them, Ys would be a veritable
paradise!";"";"";
35755;"All the depressing rumors flying
around lately have been getting
me down...";"";"";
357a7;"Eeeeeeeeek!";"";"";
357b9;"I actually saw a demon with my own
eyes a short while ago. It really
was just as scary as they say!";"";"";
35823;"...Cute demon. But still a
demon. 'Eek' IS the proper
response, no?";"";"";
3586d;"My man is a good man.
A reliable man. A real
man's man!";"";"";
358ab;"What a splendid lad you are!";"";"";
358cf;"You say you went into the
mines to help Lilia?";"";"";
35905;"Nice job! I know someone
who will be very, very
happy to see it.";"";"";
3594d;"You found some Iron Ore?";"";"";
3596d;"Since we can't look for medicinal
herbs or mine for ore as a result,
prices are very much on the rise.";"";"";
359db;"The old Rasteenie Mine has become
far too dangerous to enter these
days, thanks to the demons.";"";"";
35a41;"...You hungry, little guy?";"";"";
35a63;"Dearie dearie dearie...";"";"";
35a81;"Oh, dear...";"";"";
35a93;"I wasn't worried!";"";"";
35aab;"Hmm? Did something happen?";"";"";
35acd;"He sometimes gets in the way,
but I put up with him.";"";"";
35b09;"Leggs is here today.
How unusual!";"";"";
35b31;"Where on Ys could that Lilia
have run off to?! Poor Banoa
must be worried sick!";"";"";
35b87;"Back safe, you say?
Fantastic!";"";"";
35bad;"When I first heard that Bohtz
had disappeared, I thought my
heart was going to stop!";"";"";
35c09;"Nice and warm lately. Makes me
want to sit out in the sun and
toast my skin a bit...";"";"";
35c65;"Hope it's good tidings.
I'm sick of the bad sort!";"";"";
35c9d;"There seems to be quite a
commotion in the village,
wouldn't you say?";"";"";
35ce9;"Hello. The master of the house isn't
in right now, I'm afraid. But do make
yourself at home, if you wish.";"";"";
35d59;"Astal and old man Leggs both
live here, though they're not
related to one another.";"";"";
35db3;"Me? I'm Master Astal's
housekeeper.";"";"";
35ddd;"Hello. The masters of the house aren't
in right now, I'm afraid. But do make
yourself at home, if you wish.";"";"";
35e4f;"If you need to see them for
something, I guarantee that's
where you'll find them.";"";"";
35ea7;"Astal and Leggs are almost always
in the Ruins of Moondoria, day in
and day out. They're obsessed!";"";"";
35f11;"Wha...? You look like a demon,
but...you're not, are you? You
somehow strike me as human...";"";"";
35f73;"I'm almost always in Moondoria, but
even Moondoria fanatics have to eat,
right? So, I come home to eat!";"";"";
35fe1;"As you've probably guessed,
this is my home.";"";"";
36015;"Oh, it's you, is it?";"";"";
36031;"#c2#A sense of evil permeates
this place.#c#";"";"";
36065;"Oooh... Which one should
I go with...?";"";"";
36093;"...Huh?! Oh, crap... Was I talking
in my sleep again?!";"";"";
360d1;"If that hole hadn't opened
up, we'd've been stuck in
there for good!";"";"";
3611d;"Haven't seen you before,
stranger. Who might you
be?";"";"";
36159;"You know what they say... Walk a
thousand miles, then walk a thousand
more. It's all about getting started!";"";"";
361cb;"I'm not really sure what I mean by
that-- I do tend to ramble-- but, you
know...roar, bare fangs, and all that!";"";"";
36241;"I just keep meeting new people
lately. Yesiree, I'm a popular
one! I must be a looker!";"";"";
3629f;"No clue why anything that happens
happens. It's a mystery!";"";"";
362e1;"I always get sleepy on the job,
no matter how much sleep I
actually get the night before.";"";"";
36341;"Adol...";"";"";
3634f;"While you wait for her return, you may
feel free to rest here for as long as
you'd like.";"";"";
363af;"I suspect she's gone off in search of a
means to lend you her aid.";"";"";
363f9;"Don't worry about Lilia, Adol. I have
faith in that child.";"";"";
3643b;"I wonder where she could have gone...
I hope she's all right...";"";"";
36481;"Adol, have you seen my daughter? I'm
saddened to say she's disappeared.";"";"";
364cf;"He made a silent oath to find some way
of returning her to normal.";"";"";
36519;"Adol couldn't bring himself to tell
Banoa of Lilia's fate.";"";"";
3655b;"I wonder where she could have gone...
I hope she's all right...";"";"";
365a1;"Adol, have you seen my daughter? I'm
saddened to say she's disappeared.";"";"";
365ef;"From now on, you may come here to rest
whenever you'd like, for as long as you
wish!";"";"";
3664b;"You've saved my daughter's life!";"";"";
36673;"How can I ever thank you, Adol?";"";"";
36699;"With this medicine, Lilia's illness
will be a thing of the past. It's
practically a miracle!";"";"";
366fd;"How can I ever thank you, Adol?";"";"";
36723;"Truly, with this medicine, Lilia shall
live to see another day!";"";"";
36769;"...Thank the Goddesses! You have no idea
what a hero you are to her, and to me as
well!";"";"";
367c7;"Is that...the medicine to cure my
daughter's illness? Truly?!";"";"";
3680b;"If you need to recuperate before you go,
there's always a place for you here.
Come by anytime.";"";"";
36871;"And since you did rescue Dr. Flair,
I can honestly say that I have every
confidence in your abilities.";"";"";
368df;"Will you seek them out, Adol? I hate to
ask so much of you, but you're her only
hope!";"";"";
3693b;"According to him, we need two ingre-
dients for the medicine to cure Lilia
of her illness...";"";"";
3699f;"Thank you for saving Dr. Flair.";"";"";
369c5;"Thank you, Adol, for saving Dr. Flair.";"";"";
369f3;"Rasteenie Mine is a pit of danger.
It was only a matter of time before
something like this happened...";"";"";
36a61;"How dreadful... Although gifted in
medicine, Dr. Flair needs to exercise
better judgment when picking herbs!";"";"";
36ad5;"You mustn't strain yourself. Recover
fully, THEN proceed on whatever quest
you've undertaken.";"";"";
36b39;"Should you really be up and about
already? Your wounds are still fresh!";"";"";

36f1b;"Could you deliver this letter to
Leonor's brother, #c2#Dr. Flair#c#?";"";"";
36f67;"...If you're going out, Adol, I have a
favor to ask.";"";"";
36fa3;"...I feel so bad for the poor girl. She
doesn't even know she's sick!";"";"";
36fef;"I suppose the best place to start would
be the #c2#clinic#c#. It's possible he returned
without me realizing it.";"";"";
37067;"So would you please search for Dr. Flair
on my behalf, and give him this letter
for me?";"";"";
370c5;"And if something isn't done soon, I fear
what may become of my poor daughter...";"";"";
3711b;"I'd like to discuss it with Dr. Flair,
but I don't think he's come back to the
village yet.";"";"";
3717d;"...Lilia may look well, but in truth,
she suffers from a severe illness.";"";"";
371cd;"Everything's changing... Nothing can
possibly stay the same anymore.";"";"";
37219;"So...the time has come for Ys to rejoin
the rest of the world.";"";"";
3725f;"But all I can think about, amidst all
this chaos...is Lilia.";"";"";
372a3;"I think everyone knows that we're living
in a time of great change. We're now
witnessing history in the making!";"";"";
37319;"Ys was at peace for seven hundred years,
until the demons arrived...";"";"";
37365;"I somehow get the feeling that your
actions will ultimately determine
the course of this land's destiny.";"";"";
373d5;"I do know of them, and I know that
they're extremely significant...but
in what way? That's the question!";"";"";
37445;"It's as I thought... You bear the six
#c2#Books of Ys#c#.";"";"";
37485;"But that's a thing of the past. Nowadays
the only people I know who still talk
about it are the elder and old Leggs.";"";"";
37501;"The old folks and the descendants
of the Priests used to tell of Ys'
history and folklore all the time...";"";"";
37571;"According to legend, Ys has been
floating in the sky for seven
hundred years.";"";"";
375c5;"Please, make yourself at home. Have a
look around the village, if you'd like!";"";"";
37619;"This is Lance Village. In Ys. You
collapsed near a place we call the
Ruins of Moondoria.";"";"";
37679;"Are you...from another world or
something?";"";"";
376ab;"This land has been called Ys for ages.
You speak as if you just got here!";"";"";
376fb;"Please, make yourself at home. Have a
look around the village, if you'd like!";"";"";
3774f;"This is Lance Village. In Ys. You
collapsed near a place we call the
Ruins of Moondoria.";"";"";
377af;"Are you...from another world or
something?";"";"";
377e1;"Rasteenie Mine is particularly
dangerous, you see, so we keep
the entrance under constant guard.";"";"";
37849;"Ever since the demons showed up, though,
none of the villagers dare go near it.
(Well...almost none.)";"";"";
378b5;"These days, Moondoria is in shambles.
In its heyday, though, it flourished
under the jurisdiction of the Priests.";"";"";
3792d;"It's not worth the risk, though, if you
ask me. Wounds do heal, but broken necks
do not.";"";"";
3798d;"There are medicinal herbs to be found
within the abandoned mine, and some
still attempt to find them on occasion.";"";"";
37a05;"You're actually quite precious to us--
even though we've only known you for a
short time.";"";"";
37a65;"Lilia's taken quite an interest in your
safety. As have I. We don't wish to see
any harm fall upon you, Adol Christin!";"";"";
37ae3;"Please do be careful when you approach
the demons, however.";"";"";
37b25;"I thank you, from the bottom of my
heart, for the lengths you've gone to
on Lilia's behalf.";"";"";
37b87;"I beg you, Adol, won't you please find
the Celceta Flower for her? The poor
girl doesn't even know she's sick...";"";"";
37bff;"The Celceta Flower is said to grow in
the depths of the old Mine. We must have
it in order to make medicine for Lilia.";"";"";
37c7d;"But ever since the demons began nesting
there six months ago, all of that's
changed...";"";"";
37cdb;"Rasteenie Mine was once a source of
both iron ore and medicinal herbs for
the entire village.";"";"";
37d3f;"If you become fatigued or injured,
there'll always be a bed and a hot
meal waiting for you here.";"";"";
37da7;"...You're going in to rescue him, I
assume? I thought as much. Just be
careful, Adol! Don't get hurt!";"";"";
37e13;"Dr. Flair is trapped in the abandoned
mine?!";"";"";
37e47;"Oh, dear... Is there anything I can do
to assist in his rescue?";"";"";
37e8d;"Dr. Flair is trapped in the abandoned
mine?!";"";"";
37ec1;"Dr. Flair still goes down to pick herbs
every now and again, though-- despite
our best efforts to convince him not to!";"";"";
37f3f;"But ever since the demons showed up...
well, even our half-hearted version of
mining has seemed far less viable.";"";"";
37fb7;"Iron ore and herbs are quite abundant
around such spots. We'd often gather
them, and call it 'mining.'";"";"";
38025;"There are some old ruins intermixed with
the mine tunnels at Rasteenie...";"";"";
38075;"That's my only wish!";"";"";
38091;"All I want is for Lilia to be happy...";"";"";
380bf;"If I were ever to lose her...";"";"";
380e3;"Lilia is the only reason I've been able
to cope with the horrors that continue
to plague us here...";"";"";
3814d;"If I were ever to lose her...";"";"";
38171;"Lilia is the only reason I've been able
to cope with the horrors that continue
to plague us here...";"";"";
381db;"My husband passed away when Lilia was
very young, so it's just been the two of
us for most of her life.";"";"";
38249;"I'll wait here for her. I know she'll be
home before long, and I don't want the
house to be empty when she gets here!";"";"";
382c5;"Knowing her as I do, I believe she must
be on a personal mission to help you, as
best as she can.";"";"";
3832d;"Yes...";"";"";
3833b;"You found Lilia? And she's okay?! Oh,
thank the Goddesses! And thank you, too,
for letting me know!";"";"";
383a5;"If she wants to put herself in danger
for your sake...well, I know her well
enough to say that she's unstoppable!";"";"";
3841d;"Lilia owes you her life.";"";"";
3843d;"Oh, Lilia... Where could you have gone?!";"";"";
3846d;"She was seen briefly at the village
gate, but not once since then.";"";"";
384b7;"She left a while ago... Mentioned
something about going to the Ruins.";"";"";
38503;"If so, then I suppose it would be
fruitless to ask you to remain here,
and keep an old woman company...no?";"";"";
38575;"Lilia believes that you have some great
mission you must carry out.";"";"";
385bf;"Yet, in spite of that, she never once
let it show...for my sake.";"";"";
38607;"Apparently, Lilia DID know she was sick,
after all...";"";"";
38643;"Now we have the medicine, and Lilia is
saved! Thank you, Adol. You're like an
angel of mercy!";"";"";
386a7;"If she's to die from this, at least
she'll die happy.";"";"";
386e3;"...I haven't said anything. I don't have
the heart! It would do her no good to
know.";"";"";
3873f;"How can fate be so cruel as to inflict
the same malady upon her?!";"";"";
38787;"His ran its course much more quickly,
however. And was far more severe.";"";"";
387d5;"Lilia's illness is the same one that
took her father from me...";"";"";
3881b;"She took a basket with her, so I believe
she's picking apples. If you go out for
a walk, you may run into her.";"";"";
38891;"Lilia's out at the moment.";"";"";
388b3;"If there's anything you wish to know,
feel free to ask.";"";"";
388f1;"I can't ask you to stay within the
village, but I can and will ask you
to be wary of the demons!";"";"";
38959;"Are you honestly feeling better? Don't
lie to me! If you're still injured, you
should rest...";"";"";
389bd;"...That's what I started thinking,
anyway. After you saved me. It was
like...an epiphany, I guess.";"";"";
38a27;"After all, there must be a reason
for the demons to have resurfaced
after so many hundreds of years...no?";"";"";
38a97;"I mean, certainly, defeating the demons
would be better than not...but I don't
think they're the underlying issue here.";"";"";
38b15;"Everyone says that if there were no
demons, we could all be happy and at
peace, but...I'm not sure that's true!";"";"";
38b8b;"Just think what might have happened if
they continued to nest down there...
It could have been a disaster!";"";"";
38bfd;"I can't believe Gila had demons lurking
in his basement. It's like something out
of a child's nightmare!";"";"";
38c6d;"You've done a great service not just for
Gila, but for us all. Thank you, Adol!";"";"";
38cc3;"Demons in Gila's basement...
How terrifying to think about!";"";"";
38d05;"...So you plan to exterminate them,
then? Just be careful, Adol... I don't
want to lose you!";"";"";
38d69;"Well, that might explain what everyone's
been hearing during the night. Demon
voices, perhaps?";"";"";
38dcf;"Are you saying...that Gila's monsters
are real?!";"";"";
38e07;"But if that's true...then I must say,
I don't like having it within Lance
one bit. Be very careful with it, Adol!";"";"";
38e7f;"Legend has it that demons are drawn to
its sound.";"";"";
38eb7;"It looks like the #c2#Evil Bell#c# that the
Priests used long ago, to lead demons
out of villages...";"";"";
38f23;"...I must ask you, though... What in the
world is that ghastly bell you've got?!";"";"";
38f7b;"With such horrible things happening
around every corner, your visit is
like a ray of sunshine for us, Adol!";"";"";
38fed;"And many people have been hearing
demonic voices coming from beneath
the ground, late at night...";"";"";
39055;"The elder saw two beautiful girls in
the Ruins, and he said they looked
just like the Goddesses...";"";"";
390bf;"Some strange things started happening
not long before you arrived here.";"";"";
3910d;"The area around Lance Village has
become so treacherous, one can
scarcely go for a walk anymore!";"";"";
39175;"This was once a peaceful village...
until the demons started showing up
in the abandoned Rasteenie Mine.";"";"";
391e5;"Lately, I've been listless and slug-
gish...but now, it's like I've caught
a second wind. It's wonderful!";"";"";
39255;"I feel as if I could run a marathon,
in fact!";"";"";
39289;"I'm all better now, thanks to you.";"";"";
392b3;"...That worries me. I...don't want you
to get hurt, Adol...";"";"";
392f5;"And...";"";"";
39303;"I know that what you're doing will alter
the course of destiny. Not just Lance,
but all of Ys hangs in the balance.";"";"";
3937d;"...I want to be able to help you, Adol.";"";"";
393ab;"I...";"";"";
393b7;"I don't know why...but I want to help
you. More than I've ever wanted to do
anything else in my entire life.";"";"";
3942b;"I feel like I should be doing something,
too...";"";"";
39461;"But...";"";"";
3946f;"So I don't wish to cause her any
unnecessary concern.";"";"";
394ab;"I'm really all my mother has.";"";"";
394cf;"I'm sure it was harder for her, though,
to know what was going on and have no
way of helping...";"";"";
39535;"And I thought SHE didn't know, so I was
doing the same...";"";"";
39575;"She knew of my illness, but was keeping
it secret, for my sake. She thought I
didn't know.";"";"";
395d7;"My father died when I was just a baby,
so my mother had to raise me all by
herself.";"";"";
39631;"I'm sure it was harder for her, though,
to know what was going on and have no
way of helping...";"";"";
39697;"And I thought SHE didn't know, so I was
doing the same...";"";"";
396d7;"Mother knew of my illness, but was
keeping it secret, for my sake.
She thought I didn't know.";"";"";
3973b;"I...want to help you, Adol.";"";"";
3975d;"I...would like to talk to you again
sometime...soon...";"";"";
3979b;"When I talk to you, I get this warm
feeling in my heart.";"";"";
397db;"Oh, how cute! He's so fuzzy-wuzzy,
and has such a handsome do!";"";"";
39821;"My, my. If it isn't a Roo!
Quite a rare sight...";"";"";
39859;"What are you doing so far
from home, little one?";"";"";
39891;"Well, now, if it isn't Adol!";"";"";
398b5;"#c0#He fell out of the sky?!";"";"";
398d9;"#c0#Yes. That's what it looked
like, anyway.";"";"";
3990d;"#c0#How is he, Leonor?";"";"";
3992b;"#c0#I think that should do it,
actually. His wounds aren't
particularly dire.";"";"";
3997f;"#c0#He'll be fine. He just
needs a little rest.";"";"";
399b5;"#c0#...Look, he's coming to!";"";"";
399d9;"Just relax, please. This
is a safe place. My mother
and I live here.";"";"";
39a25;"What's your name?";"";"";
39a3d;"#c2#Adol gave his name.";"";"";
39a5b;"I should be getting back to the
clinic. My brother's likely
returned by now.";"";"";
39aaf;"Lilia. Banoa. Try to let
him sleep for a while.
As long as he needs.";"";"";
39afb;"Adol Christin, your injuries are
nothing serious. You're going to
be just fine, with a bit of rest!";"";"";
39b65;"Thanks for your help!";"";"";
39b85;"We'll answer your questions
later, Adol. For now...get
some sleep. You need it!";"";"";
39bdb;"If I went around moping all the time,
the only thing that would do is make
my mother sad...and make me feel guilty.";"";"";
39c55;"I mean...";"";"";
39c65;"So I was...trying to focus on the
happiest things I could. I figured,
if I WERE to die...why obsess over it?";"";"";
39cd9;"And I did wonder...if I was actually
going to die. If my long, happy life
would be cut short...";"";"";
39d3f;"...I knew. The whole time.";"";"";
39d61;"Thank you so much, Adol.";"";"";
39d81;"...Lilia.";"";"";
39d91;"Thank you so much, Adol.";"";"";
39db1;"Take it, with my blessings.";"";"";
39dd3;"I...have a little something for you. I
thought perhaps you might find a use for
it.";"";"";
39e2d;"Supposedly, that wand's been imbued
with the magic of Hadal, the governing
Priest of Earth.";"";"";
39e8f;"I can only hope it will do the same for
you.";"";"";
39ec3;"It's bestowed Hadal's protection upon my
father's family for generations.";"";"";

to Lilia.";"";"";

more alive than I've ever
felt before!";"";"";

39fdf;"It's like...I could
run a marathon!";"";"";

Thank you, Adol...and Dr. Flair...
My daughter is alive! She's ALIVE!";"";"";

3a0fb;"You seem kind of beaten down...";"";"";
3a121;"Hey, are you okay?";"";"";
3a13b;"I wonder how those two
are doing nowadays...";"";"";
3a16f;"Our forefathers had the good
fortune to live alongside the
Goddesses.";"";"";
3a1bb;"...In which case, he's
probably a GOOD demon!";"";"";
3a1ef;"There was a demon named Keith locked up
too, right? Not sure what that's about.
Seems he defied the black-robed man...";"";"";
3a26d;"One of the demons was foolish
enough to disobey his orders.
That did NOT end well...";"";"";
3a2c9;"I saw the man in the black
robe a little while ago.";"";"";
3a303;"The Roda Leaf fits squarely over your
mouth, but your nose is still exposed.
So make sure not to sniff around!";"";"";
3a379;"Ours is a peace-loving clan. Peace,
love, sleep, food...and information.";"";"";

Seven Habits of Highly Successful
Gentlemen, you ask?";"";"";

is a long and winding one. You must
work hard to be worthy of the title!";"";"";

I have food, females and comfortable
bedding like you wouldn't believe!";"";"";

Sometimes, a little know-how is all
you really need in life!";"";"";

I am the very model of a modern
major gentleman!";"";"";

Successful Gentlemen.";"";"";

old ways, have you?";"";"";

world. But as they say, only the

always be fearless, yet compassionate!";"";"";

and groom thy neighbor's tail...and
'Courage' to face any peril head-on...";"";"";

the harshest of circumstances, and run
free with the pikkards! ...Can YOU?";"";"";

It is the tool of a true gentleman...
a shield against poison gas!";"";"";

3bc3d;"You see my brother,
Brooce, over there?";"";"";
3bc6b;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3bc9b;"My, my, my...
What a day it's been!";"";"";
3bcc5;"If it weren't for all the nuts
and berries I've hoarded, we'd
probably have starved by now!";"";"";
3bd27;"See...my brother Brooce?
He's actually really poor!";"";"";
3bd61;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3bd91;"He pretty much never does anything, so
he's all atrophied. Even though there's
no shortage of stuff he SHOULD be doing!";"";"";
3be0f;"See, my brother Brooce...
He has no stamina at all!";"";"";
3be49;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3be79;"Even though he has tons of
other stuff he should be
doing, all the time!";"";"";
3bec9;"See, my brother Brooce...
takes FOUR HOURS every day
to fix his hair!";"";"";
3bf15;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3bf45;"Just the other day, I saw this
human adventurer with red hair
getting medieval on some demons...";"";"";
3bfad;"My brother, Brooce?
He's a huuuuuuuuuge
scaredy-cat!";"";"";
3bfe9;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3c019;"...So Brooce shouts, like,
#c4#'Eeeeyaaaaarrrgh!'#c#, and runs home
with his tail between his legs!";"";"";
3c083;"He won't let me go outside, and
every time I ask him why, he just
says, 'Because it's dangerous!'";"";"";
3c0eb;"See, my brother Brooce...
is really bad at justifying
his rules!";"";"";
3c133;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3c163;"If he ever does something
bad, he forgets all about
it within a half a day!";"";"";
3c1b5;"You know my brother, Brooce?
He has, like, the WORST memory!";"";"";
3c1f9;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3c229;"He's been looking all over the place
for a Roda Seed that he says he lost.
But actually, he ate it!";"";"";
3c293;"My brother, Brooce, is
sooooo absent-minded!";"";"";
3c2c7;"Hey, can I let you in
on a little secret?";"";"";
3c2f7;"Every time a demon starts
chasing him, he's all like...";"";"";

real loudmouth.";"";"";

It's the Sacred Cup!
At long last!";"";"";

old well is another of my research
specimens...and a mighty good one!";"";"";

Cup, now filled with water.";"";"";
3c86d;"Marvelous!";"";"";

certainly wasn't without its
charms...";"";"";
3c8c9;"Ahh, you're a sight for
sore eyes, m'boy!";"";"";
3c8f9;"Yes, yes, you're very cute, and I CAN
understand your language...but why
not just talk to me as a human being?";"";"";

cursed again...";"";"";

did you come to possess this?!";"";"";

Legend has it that that pendant was
once worn by one of the Goddesses.";"";"";

effective. You can use that pendant

It's a blessed spring!";"";"";

3da2f;"It's been ages since I've gotten my
hands on Iron Ore. I've had to double
my prices just to get by!";"";"";
3da99;"I bet Lazlo could really use some of
that iron for smithing. What do you say?
Would you sell it to me?";"";"";
3db07;"Haven't seen iron around here in a long,

glint of Iron Ore I see, or do my

sit with you?";"";"";
3df43;"Thanks.";"";"";
3df51;"Thanks. This is just what we need to
make some quality merchandise.";"";"";
3df9b;"Iron Ore is the lifeblood of our
business. If you should change your
mind, be sure you let me know.";"";"";
3e005;"Not selling? That's a real shame...";"";"";
3e02f;"Well, Iron Ore is a pretty valuable
commodity, after all. If you should
change your mind, please let me know.";"";"";

3e0cd;"Leave";"";"";
3e0d9;"Buy armor";"";"";
3e0e9;"Buy shield";"";"";
3e0fb;"Buy sword";"";"";
3e10b;"Speak to Guido";"";"";
3e121;"Have a look around!";"";"";
3e139;"I may not have anything new, but have a
look around. It's always an honor to
sell to an upstanding man like yourself.";"";"";
3e1b5;"You're my most valued customer, you
know. No joke!";"";"";
3e1ef;"That's one fine suit of armor you've got
there.";"";"";
3e225;"Damned beasts'll have to think twice
before they come knocking, if they know
what's good for 'em!";"";"";
3e28d;"Thanks to that Iron Ore, I've been able
to get the villagers better outfitted
for protection from demon attacks.";"";"";
3e305;"Be sure to come back and buy yourself a
suit when it's done!";"";"";
3e349;"It won't be long now until I've got some
really solid armor lined up for you.";"";"";
3e39d;"That ore you sold me was a real
lifesaver.";"";"";
3e3cf;"If you come across any Iron Ore, I'll
buy it from you for 6000 Gold. More than
I can afford, but what choice do I have?";"";"";
3e44d;"And with all the demons running around,
we could really use new equipment, you
know?";"";"";
3e4a9;"We're out of #c2#Iron Ore#c#, so we can't make
any new armor.";"";"";
3e4ed;"If I just had some iron ore, I'd be able
to hand it over and get some really
high-quality armor made.";"";"";
3e559;"Lazlo's an excellent armorsmith, but he
isn't really able to do much with his
skills these days.";"";"";
3e5c1;"...But, that's why we don't have any
really good armor here.";"";"";
3e605;"Can't say I blame him. I wouldn't want
to risk my life down there, either!";"";"";
3e657;"A friend of mine is a miner, so I asked
him about it, but he said there's no way
he's going down there.";"";"";
3e6c5;"It's just too risky to look for ore
while Rasteenie is swarming with demons.";"";"";
3e719;"I really wish I had a better selection
for you, but we just don't have the
materials we need.";"";"";
3e77d;"Always remember, though, to keep what
you need and what you can afford in
balance. It's an important decision!";"";"";
3e7f3;"We have some fine swords here.";"";"";
3e819;"Nothing";"";"";
3e827;"Talwar";"";"";
3e835;"Long Sword";"";"";
3e847;"Short Sword";"";"";
3e859;"So, what'll it be?";"";"";
3e871;"We have some fine armor available. It
doesn't come cheap, though.";"";"";
3e8b9;"You'll have to settle for our normal
stock, until it's done.";"";"";
3e8fd;"Sorry... The new armor isn't ready
just yet.";"";"";
3e931;"This is all we have in stock.";"";"";

materials.";"";"";
3e987;"Nothing";"";"";
3e995;"Plate Mail";"";"";
3e9a7;"Breast Plate";"";"";
3e9bb;"Chain Mail";"";"";
3e9cd;"So, what'll it be?";"";"";
3e9e5;"Nothing";"";"";
3e9f3;"Chain Mail";"";"";
3ea05;"So, what'll it be?";"";"";
3ea1d;"Nothing";"";"";
3ea2b;"Chain Mail";"";"";
3ea3d;"So, what'll it be?";"";"";
3ea55;"Anyway, have a look around. Surround
yourself in the opulence of my stock,
and imagine, would if they were yours...";"";"";
3eacf;"People tend to think of shields as less
important than armor, but you'd be
surprised how useful they are.";"";"";
3eb3f;"Nothing";"";"";
3eb4d;"Large Shield";"";"";
3eb61;"Small Shield";"";"";
3eb75;"Wooden Shield";"";"";
3eb89;"So, what'll it be?";"";"";
3eba1;"#c2#200 Gold#c# should cover you.";"";"";
3ebc9;"I wouldn't put too much faith in it if
you're going to be fighting demons, but
it's certainly better than nothing!";"";"";
3ec43;"It's pretty small and easy to handle.";"";"";
3ec6f;"Don't buy";"";"";
3ec7f;"Buy";"";"";
3ec89;"You want it?";"";"";
3ec9b;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3ed01;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3ed2d;"I'll let it go for a cool #c2#1000 Gold#c#.";"";"";
3ed5f;"This is definitely what you want if
you're planning to do some serious
fighting with the demons!";"";"";
3edc7;"It's a little on the heavy side, with a
long blade.";"";"";
3ee01;"Don't buy";"";"";
3ee11;"Buy";"";"";
3ee1b;"You want it?";"";"";
3ee2d;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3ee93;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3eebf;"It's #c2#5000 Gold#c#, and not a GP less.";"";"";
3eeef;"It takes a fair degree of skill to use
it, but you seem to know what you're
doing. You'll pick up on it in no time!";"";"";
3ef69;"Now, is this not a work of art? This
curved blade has an exceptionally fine
cutting edge.";"";"";
3efc9;"Don't buy";"";"";
3efd9;"Buy";"";"";
3efe3;"You want it?";"";"";
3eff5;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f05b;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3f087;"It's also only #c2#500 Gold#c#, though!";"";"";
3f0b5;"It's light and easy to move around in,
but doesn't offer that much in the way
of defense.";"";"";
3f115;"It's a suit of woven chain mail. It'll
deflect sword strikes and offer marginal
protection against mortal wounds.";"";"";
3f18d;"Don't buy";"";"";
3f19d;"Buy";"";"";
3f1a7;"You want it?";"";"";
3f1b9;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f21f;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3f24b;"I'll take #c2#2000 Gold#c# for it.";"";"";
3f275;"It's heavier than the Chain Mail, but
offers much better defense.";"";"";
3f2bd;"This armor is designed to protect the
chest with iron plating.";"";"";
3f303;"Don't buy";"";"";
3f313;"Buy";"";"";
3f31d;"You want it?";"";"";
3f32f;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f395;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3f3c1;"It's been appraised at #c2#8000 Gold#c#. By me.";"";"";
3f3f7;"It offers full-body protection, so
you'll have nothing to fear from those
demons at all!";"";"";
3f457;"This is the finest armor available, made
of specially-molded metal plates.";"";"";
3f4a9;"Don't buy";"";"";
3f4b9;"Buy";"";"";
3f4c3;"You want it?";"";"";
3f4d5;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f53b;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3f567;"...Probably fine to start with, though.
But you should definitely upgrade as
soon as you can. How's #c2#100 Gold#c# sound?";"";"";
3f5e9;"It's a hard wooden shield. It's light
and easy to handle, but I wouldn't
suggest going up against demons with it.";"";"";
3f661;"Don't buy";"";"";
3f671;"Buy";"";"";
3f67b;"You want it?";"";"";
3f68d;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f6f3;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3f71f;"If you have the skill to use it, it
should suit your needs well. I think
#c2#1500 Gold#c# is a fair asking price.";"";"";
3f797;"It's not too big, as shields go...but
it's strong and easy to handle.";"";"";
3f7e3;"Don't buy";"";"";
3f7f3;"Buy";"";"";
3f7fd;"You want it?";"";"";
3f80f;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f875;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3f8a1;"It's just that good! Which is why I'm
asking #c2#6000 Gold#c# for it.";"";"";
3f8ed;"If you're skilled enough to use the
Large Shield, you should make short
work of the demons around here.";"";"";
3f95b;"Don't buy";"";"";
3f96b;"Buy";"";"";
3f975;"You want it?";"";"";
3f987;"You have one of these already, don't
you? I'm glad you like it, but there's
no need to buy two!";"";"";
3f9ed;"Oh, I'm afraid you don't have enough.";"";"";
3fa19;"But you don't seem vicious, so...I guess
I can let you go. THIS time.";"";"";
3fa65;"You've got some nerve to just...waltz
into an armory like that!";"";"";
3faab;"Please go to the counter if you want to
buy something.";"";"";
3fae9;"But you don't seem vicious, so...I guess
I can let you go. THIS time.";"";"";
3fb35;"You've got some nerve to just...waltz
into an armory like that!";"";"";
3fb7b;"Thanks for your business. Come again
soon!";"";"";
3fbad;"One bite of me and you're a dead little
fuzzy-wuzzy.";"";"";
3fbe9;"I've got special armor on.";"";"";
3fc0b;"Thanks to you, Guido's fully restocked.
Take a look around! Bask in the glow
of my quality smithing!";"";"";
3fc77;"Heh, what do you think? Nice work on the
Breast Plate and Plate Mail, no?";"";"";
3fcc7;"Give me just a little time, and I'll be
ready to show you my newest creations!";"";"";
3fd1d;"Thanks to you, I'll have no trouble
crafting all kinds of quality armor.";"";"";
3fd6d;"Well, if it isn't the guy who sold us
the Iron Ore!";"";"";
3fda7;"Well, I'm just afraid I'm going to lose
my touch. I mean, it's been so long
since I last worked metal!";"";"";
3fe15;"I'm at an utter loss here... If we only
had some Iron Ore, we could get some
work done, but as it is...";"";"";
3fe83;"...I won't actually do that, of course,
but the thought HAS crossed my mind.
That's how desperately I want some ore!";"";"";
3feff;"I might as well try my luck at going
down into the mines myself...";"";"";
3ff49;"For someone like me, not being able to
work is like not being able to breathe.";"";"";
3ff9f;"Ahh, it's no use... Without Iron Ore,
there's just nothing for me to do!";"";"";
3ffef;"You've got some real promise. Thanks
very much for what you've done on behalf
of us all.";"";"";
4004f;"Dr. Flair's made it back safe...and I
hear you're the one who rescued him.";"";"";
400a1;"Please, take this with you. Consider it
a token of my gratitude.";"";"";
400e9;"Oh, don't worry about it. I owe Dr.
Flair a favor or two, myself.";"";"";
40131;"Now, if I could just get ahold of some
Iron Ore, this torture would be over and
done with!";"";"";
40193;"What's that? Dr. Flair had an accident
in Rasteenie?!";"";"";
401cf;"...So I can't help thinking I'm
at least partially responsible for
putting him in danger...";"";"";
40231;"You know, I asked him to keep an
eye out for any Iron Ore...";"";"";
40275;"Can't make anything else
without iron ore.";"";"";
402a7;"Sorry, but Chain Mail is all I've got
right now.";"";"";
402df;"Are you looking to buy some armor?";"";"";
40309;"So how are your travels going? You may
be young and resilient, but you should
still take it easy from time to time.";"";"";
40383;"Hey there, Adol.";"";"";
4039b;"No one's found Lilia yet, but I have
faith that she's all right.";"";"";
403e3;"So how are your travels going? You may
be young and resilient, but you should
still take it easy from time to time.";"";"";
4045d;"Hey there, Adol.";"";"";
40475;"Everyone's worried about her. We have no
idea where she could be...";"";"";
404bf;"You may have heard, but Lilia's gone
missing.";"";"";
404f3;"Hey there, Adol.";"";"";
4050b;"Helping people makes you feel really
good, doesn't it? I'm so glad to hear
that Lilia's okay!";"";"";
4056f;"Oh, my... What's wrong?";"";"";
4058d;"I never even considered the possibility
of a cave-in. Seems the most obvious
concern in the world, though, now...";"";"";
40605;"I know the layout of the abandoned mine
quite well, but as a result, I got cocky
and assumed I was ready for anything.";"";"";
40683;"Hey there, Adol. Thank you for coming to
my rescue back there.";"";"";
406c9;"Oh, Adol! The man who bravely swooped
in and saved the day when the ceiling
came tumbling down on our doctor, no?";"";"";
40741;"...Oh, is that letter for me?";"";"";
40765;"Either way, you cleared a path through
the cave-in, and as a result, I'm able
to stand here now. You're a lifesaver!";"";"";
407e1;"Tell me, did you came down into the
mines to rescue me, or was rescuing me
simply a case of dumb luck?";"";"";
4084f;"Oh, my... Adol, is it?";"";"";
4086d;"Adol, would you please look for a Roda
Fruit and Celceta Flower in my place?
For Lilia's sake?";"";"";
408d3;"I'm sure I could find one in Rasteenie
Mine, but that place is filled with
demons. I'd never make it out alive!";"";"";
40949;"And the Celceta Flower only grows in
dark areas, close to bodies of water.";"";"";
4099b;"We used to be able to find Roda
Fruits out in the ruins.";"";"";
409db;"I'm going to need a Roda Fruit
and a Celceta Flower in order
to save her.";"";"";
40a2b;"...This is terrible! Lilia has fallen
ill?!";"";"";
40a5d;"I'll do everything in my power to save
her, and I'm hoping you'll do the same.
I'm counting on you, swordsman!";"";"";
40ad3;"I'm pretty sure you've already figured
this out, but Lilia is really a very
sweet, kindly girl.";"";"";
40b39;"Doctor! He's got a Roda Fruit and
a Celceta Flower!";"";"";
40b73;"...Amazing!";"";"";
40b85;"Hmm? Wait just a moment, Adol. That
green fruit, and that blue flower...
Are they what I think they are?!";"";"";
40bf5;"We'll begin mixing the cure right away.
Please wait just a bit, would you?";"";"";
40c47;"You made it in plenty of time, too.
She'll be just fine, I'm sure of it!";"";"";
40c97;"...By the Goddesses, it's true! Adol,
you've done it! You've saved Lilia's
life!";"";"";
40cef;"What?! Tell me you're not just pulling
an old man's leg, my friend!";"";"";
40d39;"Tell her to have Lilia drink it.";"";"";
40d61;"...Done! Please, take this to Banoa,
right away!";"";"";
40d99;"Quickly, now. We may have plenty of
time, but that's no reason to dilly-
dally! Get it over to Banoa, a.s.a.p.!";"";"";
40e0f;"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";"";"";
40e85;"Thank you for agreeing to help, Adol.
Please, do your best to find Dr. Flair!";"";"";
40ed9;"Oh, good afternoon.
How may I help you?";"";"";
40f07;"#c0#Leave";"";"";
40f17;"#c0#Buy Herb";"";"";

41011;"She should be back soon, then.
Now I can finally relax!";"";"";
4104f;"You saw Lilia? Oh, thank the Goddesses
she's all right!";"";"";
4108d;"Don't worry, though... Lilia's doing
just fine. I'm sure of it. She may not
seem it, but she's a strong one!";"";"";
41101;"She said she wanted to find a better
gift for you than just herbs...but I
think she's already given you her heart.";"";"";
4117b;"Lilia said she was going out to see
you...so I'm sure she's not far off.
And she's probably okay.";"";"";
411e3;"Well, look who it is. You certainly
seem to be doing well. I almost didn't
recognize you! You're quite the fighter.";"";"";
4125d;"Has someone you know been stricken?";"";"";
41287;"Well, let's see... I can't say for sure
without seeing the patient...and curses
aren't really my area of expertise...";"";"";
41303;"Hmm? Treatment for petrification?";"";"";
4132b;"Now she's missing, and we're all kicking
ourselves for being so dense...";"";"";
4137b;"She seemed to be in high spirits, as
usual, so no one thought to stop her
when she headed for the village gate.";"";"";
413f1;"Lilia was feeling better, so she'd been
helping out a lot around the clinic.";"";"";
41445;"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";"";"";
414bb;"#c0#Nothing";"";"";

415bf;"On another note, don't you think it's
starting to get unseasonably warm?";"";"";
4160f;"Lilia's okay? You found her?! Ahhhh,
the power of love comes through once
more!";"";"";
41665;"I can't help worrying about her...";"";"";
4168f;"I mean, she's a strong-willed little
spitfire, so her illness alone won't
keep her down...but still...";"";"";
416fd;"Adol, you've been all over Ys at this
point, right? You wouldn't happen to
have seen Lilia anywhere, would you?";"";"";
41773;"That sounds more like a curse than an
illness. I don't think medicine will do
the trick!";"";"";
417d3;"You're looking for a medicine to cure
someone who's been turned to stone, you
say?!";"";"";
4182d;"What's that you say?";"";"";
41849;"If it were a disease, then sure, I could
do something about it...but a curse?
Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.";"";"";
418c5;"I sure hope she's okay out there...";"";"";
418ef;"I swear, that girl... She's just started
feeling better, and here she goes off
into the demon-infested wilderness!";"";"";
41969;"Lilia left the village a while ago, and
has yet to return.";"";"";
419ab;"What EVER will you do...?";"";"";
419cb;"And a sense of gratitude like that can
easily develop into feelings of love...";"";"";
41a21;"She owes you her life, Adol.";"";"";
41a45;"Praise the Goddesses that Lilia has been
cured!";"";"";
41a7b;"Splendid! Absolutely splendid!";"";"";
41aa1;"So Lilia's been cured?";"";"";
41abf;"If we could get the ingredients we need,
I'd be able to prepare medicine for her.";"";"";
41b17;"She's never done anything to deserve
this...";"";"";
41b4b;"Lilia is such a sweet young girl.";"";"";
41b73;"I'll say this about you, Adol: You've
got courage well beyond your years.
Please, rescue Dr. Flair, won't you?";"";"";
41be9;"Have you found the doctor yet? ...Still
trapped, is he? I see... Well, at least
we know he's uninjured.";"";"";
41c57;"You'll need the elder's permission to
enter, too, so be sure to pay him a
visit before you leave.";"";"";
41cbf;"#c2#Rasteenie Mine#c# is a dangerous place,
so don't push your luck. If you get
hurt, turn back!";"";"";
41d27;"I beg you, Adol. Anything you can do to
save Dr. Flair would be a blessing...";"";"";
41d7b;"Dr. Flair isn't in at the moment, so try
not to get yourself too banged up, okay?";"";"";
41dd3;"What's wrong, Adol?";"";"";
41ded;"Honestly, Adol... There's nothing wrong
with you, I promise!";"";"";
41e31;"...";"";"";
41e3b;"Well, if you're really insistent on
being seen right away, I can pull a
few strings. But there WILL be a fee!";"";"";
41eaf;"Though I do understand not wanting to
impose, of course.";"";"";
41eef;"You can rest at Banoa's house, too,
right? Wounds need time to heal, after
all. A rest would do you good!";"";"";
41f5f;"If you stop and rest in the village,
your wounds will gradually heal over
time. Good to keep this in mind!";"";"";
41fd1;"No";"";"";
41fdb;"Yes";"";"";
41fe5;"The bill for treatment
is #c2#20 Gold#c#, okay?";"";"";
42019;"All right. As you wish, then.";"";"";
4203d;"You want an Herb? That'll be #c2#30 Gold#c#.";"";"";
42071;"#c0#Don't buy";"";"";
42085;"#c0#Buy";"";"";
42093;"Sound good?";"";"";
420a3;"Quickly, take #c2#Lilia's Medicine#c# to her,
right away!";"";"";
420e3;"That flower made it possible to save
Lilia's life...and it's all thanks to
you!";"";"";
42139;"It won't be long now...";"";"";
42157;"Excellent work! If I mix this with a
#c2#Roda Fruit#c#, that'll be all we need to
cure Lilia for good!";"";"";
421c5;"The blue Celceta is actually quite
pretty, but it only grows in dark areas,
near water. I bet the mine's got a few.";"";"";
4223f;"Unfortunately, as the climate changed,
the hillside variety died off. But there
should still be blue Celcetas out there!";"";"";
422bf;"According to legend, the white hillside
variety represents love, while the blue
nocturnal variety represents life.";"";"";
42339;"Long ago, there were two different
varieties of Celceta Flower.";"";"";
4237f;"Yeah, it's no easy task. Keep at it,
though!";"";"";
423b3;"So, have you found a #c2#Celceta Flower#c# yet?";"";"";
423e9;"The Roda Fruit was allegedly picked from
those trees, originally. That's why it's
so rare.";"";"";
4244b;"Supposedly, there were also twin trees
that served the Goddesses. Everything
Ys comes in twos, it seems!";"";"";
424bb;"Once, the land of Ys was watched over by
twin Goddesses, who represented the twin
moons that circle this world.";"";"";
42531;"You actually found a Roda Fruit?!";"";"";
42559;"Wow, really?!";"";"";
4256d;"You know, Adol, seeing how hard you work
makes me think that you must channel the
strength of the Goddesses themselves.";"";"";
425eb;"If that's true, then you might still be
able to find some there.";"";"";
42633;"I've heard that people used to pick them
in the #c2#Ruins of Moondoria#c#.";"";"";
42685;"The Roda Fruit calms the mind and
soothes the heart. It's almost like
it restores a person's will to live.";"";"";
426f7;"But Lilia absolutely needs this
medicine. Without it, she simply
can't survive.";"";"";
4274d;"One is a #c2#Celceta Flower#c#, and the other
is a #c2#Roda Fruit#c#. And unfortunately,
neither is easy to come by these days.";"";"";
427d3;"In order to cure Lilia, we'll need two
ingredients.";"";"";
4280d;"Something's been whipping the demons
outside the village into a frenzy
lately. So watch yourself out there!";"";"";
4287f;"We'll do what we can for Lilia.
I know you will, too.";"";"";
428bb;"Dr. Flair's having enough trouble with
expenses as it is. I mean, we're trying
to make a living here! I'm very sorry.";"";"";
42937;"Um, Adol... I don't mean to sound
callous, but I can't treat you if
you won't pay the fee.";"";"";
42999;"Hahaha... Sorry about that.";"";"";
429bb;"Let's get you all patched up!";"";"";
429df;"There, all better. Try to be a bit more
careful, though, okay? It's like you're
running right into the demons, head on!";"";"";
42a5d;"Herbs are a valuable commodity these
days. If you already have one, I can't
in all good conscience sell you another.";"";"";
42ad9;"Don't you think you have enough?";"";"";
42b01;"The nurse tends to come off a bit harsh,
no? She needs to work on that bedside
manner of hers!";"";"";
42b67;"Dr. Flair's having enough trouble with
expenses as it is. I mean, we're trying
to make a living here! I'm very sorry.";"";"";
42be3;"I don't mean to seem callous, but I
can't just waive the bill. This IS a
business, after all!";"";"";
42c47;"I'm afraid you don't have enough money,
Adol.";"";"";
42c7b;"Oh-ho-ho... My apologies, my apologies!";"";"";
42ca9;"We'll begin mixing the cure right away.
Please wait just a bit, would you?";"";"";
42cfb;"You made it in plenty of time, too.
She'll be just fine, I'm sure of it!";"";"";
42d4b;"You did it, Adol! With the Celceta and
the Roda Fruit, I can finally mix the
medicine Lilia so desperately needs!";"";"";
42dc3;"Tell her to have Lilia drink it.";"";"";
42deb;"...Done! Please, take this to Banoa,
right away!";"";"";
42e23;"Quickly, now. We may have plenty of
time, but that's no reason to dilly-
dally! Get it over to Banoa, a.s.a.p.!";"";"";
42e99;"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";"";"";
42f0f;"Tell her to have Lilia drink it.";"";"";
42f37;"...Done! Please, take this to Banoa,
right away!";"";"";
42f6f;"Quickly, now. We may have plenty of
time, but that's no reason to dilly-
dally! Get it over to Banoa, a.s.a.p.!";"";"";
42fe5;"This will completely cure Lilia's
illness. You know, I never grow tired
of telling people good news like that!";"";"";
4305b;"Anyway, that should do it.
Have a nice day, little guy!";"";"";
4309d;"You can't subsist on nuts and
berries alone. You need to get
some protein in your diet, too!";"";"";
43105;"Tsk, tsk... You really should think
more about nutrition. You're clearly
not eating very well!";"";"";
4316f;"Hold still, now...";"";"";
4318d;"Since you're here, I might
as well give you a checkup.";"";"";
431cf;"But you're certainly no demon...
You're just a little cutie! Who's a
little cutie? You are! Yes you are!";"";"";
43243;"Ah, it's a Roo. Lost your way, little
fellow? You had me thinking the demons
had come attacking!";"";"";
432af;"Hmm?";"";"";
432bf;"Just to clarify, you DO need more
protein, but humans are NOT a good
source for that. Just...so you know.";"";"";
43333;"Take care out there!";"";"";
4334f;"I'm gonna hug you and kiss you and love
you forever and ever and ever!";"";"";
4339d;"Ohhhh, you're SOOOOOOO CUTE!";"";"";
433c1;"Take care!";"";"";
433d3;"...Will you accept my devotion?";"";"";
433f9;"In...in place of my life...";"";"";
4341b;"Yikes!";"";"";
43429;"Oh, you found my brother? He's
safe? That's wonderful news!";"";"";
4346b;"I'm so relieved just knowing
that he's okay.";"";"";
4349f;"You're heading off to rescue him
now, are you? Well, good luck!";"";"";
434e5;"Please, Adol! Will you
go and help my brother?";"";"";
4351b;"#c0#No";"";"";
43529;"#c0#Yes";"";"";
43537;"#c1#Agree to help?";"";"";
4354f;"Please, Adol, bring my brother
back safely from the ruins!";"";"";
43591;"I'm so worried...";"";"";
435a9;"Thank you!";"";"";
435bb;"All right! Go, Banoa! With two of us
pressuring you to find him, you really
have no choice but to give in!";"";"";
4362d;"What's that? Banoa asked you
to deliver a letter to my
brother?";"";"";
43673;"I don't have much to give, but please,
use this to buy some new equipment.";"";"";
436c5;"We're counting on you, Adol.
Show us what you're made of!";"";"";
43705;"He won't let you in without the elder's
permission. So you may wish to drop by
the elder's house before you go.";"";"";
4377b;"You'll find Astal guarding
the entrance to the Ruins.";"";"";
437b7;"Oh, and Adol... Just so you know...";"";"";
437e1;"Please, Adol, I beg of you! Don't leave
us out to dry like this! We NEED you!";"";"";
43835;"You...won't help? But...you're the
hero! Isn't it your solemn duty?!";"";"";
43881;"Oh...th-this is terrible! Just awful!";"";"";
438ad;"What's with all the
shouting, Leonor?";"";"";
438d9;"It's a carrier pigeon that just arrived,
with a note from Dr. Flair...";"";"";
43927;"It's...";"";"";
43935;"#c0#'There was a cave-in at the
Rasteenie Mine. The rocks have
blocked the passage, and I'm
trapped. I can only pray this
bird makes it back with my
letter. If you're reading this,
please send help!'";"";"";
43a07;"This is terrible! You mean to
tell me that Dr. Flair is trapped
in the abandoned Rasteenie Mine?!";"";"";
43a6f;"So it would seem. I don't
know what to do...";"";"";
43aa3;"There's nothing I
can do to help...
I'm powerless!";"";"";
43add;"I'd be completely lost down in that
mine, and the demons would overpower
me in a second!";"";"";

among us!";"";"";
43b6b;"Please, I beg of you! Rescue
my brother! We need him here,
now more than ever!";"";"";

Dr. Flair's aid?!";"";"";
43bf7;"Yes, Adol, please! It would mean a
great deal to me, as well!";"";"";

aside for you, so if you should change
your mind, you know where I'll be.";"";"";
43d31;"I'll make sure I set one of everything
aside for you, so if you should change
your mind, you know where I'll be.";"";"";
43da9;"My offer stands, so if you should change
your mind, you know where I'll be.";"";"";
43dfb;"I must say, I'm utterly stunned...
I never imagined something so sig-
nificant would happen in my lifetime.";"";"";
43e6d;"I just heard... Is it true? Has Ys
really fallen back to the surface?";"";"";
43eb9;"Of course, she's run off somewhere at
this point. And honestly, I am a bit
concerned about that!";"";"";
43f21;"...There is one girl, isn't there?";"";"";
43f4b;"Is there anyone special in your life,
Adol?";"";"";
43f7d;"...Oh, yeah, do you know Kate? She's
the woman outside who won't shut her
trap, no matter what.";"";"";
43fe3;"Now, if it were my wife out there,
it's the DEMONS I'd be worried about.
She'd give 'em one hell of a talking to!";"";"";
4405b;"Don't you feel the same way? It's
as if she's being watched over by
a guardian angel...";"";"";
440b9;"I'm not sure why, really, but I do.";"";"";
440e3;"Events of late have been simply
dreadful. Yet...somehow, I believe
Lilia will be all right.";"";"";
44145;"It's good to hear she's doing better,
though.";"";"";
44179;"You never would have known,
to look at her.";"";"";
441ab;"I heard that Banoa's daughter, Lilia,
got herself sick. I had no idea!";"";"";
441f9;"There just seem to be more and more
demons with every passing week. It's...
peculiar, is what it is!";"";"";
44265;"How do things look outside these days?";"";"";
44293;"It's made a dent in our profits, but
Flair's much better at meeting demand
than I ever was.";"";"";
442f5;"I don't mind, though. Really, it's more
convenient this way.";"";"";
44339;"I used to keep Herbs in stock, but there
hasn't been much point since Flair built
his clinic.";"";"";
4439d;"The rest... Well, you might find
something to buy. Depends on what
you need, I suppose.";"";"";
443fb;"No real must-buys, but the Wing is a
pretty indispensable tool for travelers.
Best not to leave town without one!";"";"";

demons, you'll be glad to have one of
these on hand.";"";"";

teleport you back to any town you've

needs it more?";"";"";

afraid you don't have enough money!";"";"";

hungry, and it's also a great gift
for the ladies. What do you say?";"";"";

What do you say?";"";"";

to give them one!";"";"";
44bbf;"It has no medicinal effect, but flowers
have a certain magic about them all
their own. They make great gifts.";"";"";

flower...dug up out in the field and
raised from a sprout.";"";"";

44cb3;"Do you want it?";"";"";
44cc7;"You've already got a few specimens, it

them all!";"";"";

mind or anything, but I do have to make
a living. I hope you can understand.";"";"";

afraid you don't have enough money!";"";"";
44deb;"Oh, you're buying one?";"";"";
44e09;"It was truly the pride and joy of my
shop. In a way, I actually have a bit
of seller's remorse. I wish I'd kept it!";"";"";

the only one I had.";"";"";
44ec5;"#c2#60,000 Gold#c# is what I'm asking.";"";"";
44ef3;"If I had to, I suppose I could sell it,

range of most sane individuals.";"";"";
44f67;"Quite the miracle drug, it is... It'll
bring you back to life after suffering
a mortal wound.";"";"";
44fcb;"In fact, it's the only one of its kind
in all the world. I'm legitimately
proud to own it!";"";"";
4502d;"I put it out more for bragging rights
than to actually sell it.";"";"";
45073;"I know I said before that I had no real
must-buys here...but that's because this
little vial is priceless to me!";"";"";
450eb;"Ah, you have a keen eye, sir. This is
something of true worth. I'd even go
so far as to call it my pride and joy!";"";"";
45163;"Don't buy";"";"";
45173;"Buy";"";"";
4517d;"Can you handle that?";"";"";
45197;"Such a crazy price...";"";"";
451b3;"See? You're sane, so it's out of your
price range. The system works!";"";"";
451ff;"It pains me to sell it, but I'm
impressed by your dedication.
Use it well, young man!";"";"";
4525b;"You must really have been saving up!";"";"";
45287;"I...I can't believe it. You actually
bought it!";"";"";

4530f;"If you please, sir.";"";"";
45329;"A Marle Flower, eh? Well, the blossom is

I'll give you #c2#5 Gold#c# for it.";"";"";

you want to buy something, please go to
the other side of the counter.";"";"";

remarkable...";"";"";

hold it in my hands! ...It's absolutely
stunning!";"";"";

Cleria?!";"";"";
459e3;"Well, I suppose I do have other stuff,
so take a good look around. See what you
can see...";"";"";
45a45;"I'm relieved, though. I was wondering
what I would do if another shop had
opened with equipment surpassing my own!";"";"";
45abf;"Hmmm... That's a bit worrisome, then. If
it was found, one must wonder how reli-
able it will be in the heat of battle...";"";"";
45b3f;"...Y-you FOUND it?!";"";"";
45b59;"You've acquired such great equipment...
You must be nearly invincible in it!
Where in the world did you buy it?!";"";"";
45bd1;"I, for one, am glad those days are
behind me. Business has never been
better than it is now...";"";"";
45c37;"It wasn't that long ago that Ramia was a
much colder village, so I was forced to
wear thicker clothes than I do now.";"";"";
45cb3;"Or do you just like my outfit?";"";"";
45cd9;"Perhaps you only frequent my store
because you're interested in me, hmm?";"";"";
45d29;"Nice doing business with you. You've
just about bought out the store!";"";"";
45d75;"Well, I suppose I do have other stuff,
so take a good look around. See what you
can see...";"";"";
45dd7;"Hey, you've got an Iron Shield. That's
a higher-quality item than anything I
have in stock.";"";"";
45e39;"But if you intend to fight the demons
around these parts, you'll need some
quality equipment to do the deed...";"";"";
45eaf;"I kind of get the feeling that
you're a really great guy.";"";"";

succeed. As well he should've!";"";"";

excited!";"";"";

the one to lead us into a new age of

somehow just had this feeling.";"";"";

here...";"";"";

Dabbie is an ancestor of mine. Who knew?";"";"";

did it!";"";"";

Words cannot express our gratitude. MY
gratitude...";"";"";

overcome the greatest disaster we've
ever faced.";"";"";
47b49;"...My apologies. I don't mean to bring
down the mood. This is no time for such
depressing talk!";"";"";
47baf;"But Marle...loved to create. She loved
it more than anything. And she pitied
the demons for what they lacked...";"";"";

are, and all they know, is destruction.";"";"";

well of evil intent.";"";"";

Black Pearl in my demonic hand...I was
overcome with dark desires.";"";"";
47d2d;"But now that I've been a demon myself,
I think I understand.";"";"";
47d71;"I was consumed by sorrow and rage at her
loss, so the idea of pity toward demons
seemed like nonsense.";"";"";
47ddf;"...At the time, I simply didn't
understand.";"";"";
47e11;"And with her dying breath, she said
to me, 'I pity the demons.'";"";"";
47e57;"It was like her blood had stained the
sunset...and as the life slipped from
her body, she struggled to speak...";"";"";
47ecd;"I remember what she said to me that
evening...six months ago, the day she
was taken from this mortal coil...";"";"";
47f41;"...I remembered when my sister was
killed by the demons...";"";"";
47f83;"When I was imprisoned in Burnedbless, I
lost myself in reverie.";"";"";
47fc9;"Magic has vanished from the land, and
with it, so too has the curse placed
upon me.";"";"";
48023;"Adol. It's me, Keith. I am...no longer a
demon, so I apologize if my appearance
surprises you.";"";"";
48089;"We need your courage to help us rebuild
this ravaged land. We need you to keep
us on the right path.";"";"";
480f5;"Please, stay with us here in Esteria.";"";"";
48121;"Adol, what you have accomplished here is
the true definition of heroism.";"";"";
48171;"You are the one who reclaimed that
right for us from the demons.";"";"";
481b9;"Now we can begin rebuilding. We have
control over our lives once again.";"";"";
48207;"Without the shadow of the demons looming
over us, people can again stand on their
own two feet.";"";"";
4826d;"Due to the finality of your victory, I
feel certain that Esteria will see many
changes soon. Positive changes...";"";"";
482e5;"I was standing in front of Darm Tower,
and I saw its summit engulfed in light.
And then...you shot into the sky!";"";"";
4835d;"Adol, you've really done it.";"";"";
48381;"You've brought peace back to Ys.
...Congratulations. You've truly
become a legend in your own time.";"";"";
483eb;"Everyone owes you an amazing debt of
gratitude, Adol. Thank you.";"";"";
48433;"It really makes you think...";"";"";
48457;"And by relying so heavily on the power
of magic, we sowed the seeds of our own
undoing.";"";"";
484b5;"It was made for our prosperity, and so
quickly became a part of our everyday
lives that ultimately, it controlled us.";"";"";
48531;"What an astounding power...";"";"";
48553;"So, Adol... The magic that spawned the
demons was the same magic that kept Ys
afloat, correct?";"";"";
485b9;"I had to run like mad, and I just barely
made it here in time for that final
battle of yours.";"";"";
4861d;"I woke up, and LOOKED up...and there it
was! The land of Ys, right in front of
my eyes!";"";"";
4867b;"In it, the Goddesses appeared before me,
and told me that Ys was returning to the
surface, and I was to go to the Shrine.";"";"";
486fb;"Like everybody else, I had a really odd
dream before coming here, myself.";"";"";
4874b;"You did it, Adol!";"";"";
48763;"Dogi's really eager to see
you again, by the way!";"";"";
4879b;"Maybe it did, and I somehow came back to
life...";"";"";
487d3;"When you were in the midst of the final
battle, I thought my heart was going to
explode.";"";"";
48835;"Adol! I'm so glad you're all right!";"";"";
48861;"If you have something to say, now's the
time, little lady.";"";"";
488a3;"I, um... I... I...
...Goban, you're mean...";"";"";

very happy to see you. Very...very...
happy...";"";"";
4892f;"After seven hundred years of separation,
the peoples of Ys and Esteria-- and the
rest of the world-- can reunite as one.";"";"";
489af;"One by one, all will come to believe in
themselves in this new age.";"";"";
489f9;"From this time forward, there will be
no need of Goddesses or Priests.";"";"";
48a47;"Many glorious days await. Far more now
than ever before.";"";"";
48a87;"We will never forget you or what you've
done for us, Adol. You have our eternal,
undying gratitude.";"";"";
48af1;"We will watch over the land to make sure
this peace endures.";"";"";
48b35;"The two of us will see to it that the
magic brought about by the Black Pearl
will never be revived again.";"";"";
48ba5;"...I think we're third wheels here.
We should probably let ourselves out...";"";"";
48bf7;"Adol, we're going to head back.";"";"";
48c1d;"Good thought, Maria.";"";"";
48c39;"...And now even the floating land of Ys
will be a thing of the past, as Esteria
becomes whole again.";"";"";

Priests.";"";"";

from what I could tell.";"";"";

surface, and imagine what it would

people who got turned
to stone?!";"";"";

out from the Shrine again, I'll

How adorable!";"";"";
4dd89;"Thank you so much! Why, I just
can't help but smile when I see
your face!";"";"";
4ddd9;"Are you here to raise my spirits,
little guy?";"";"";
4de0d;"I just get exhausted so easily these
days... My constitution is...well...
exhausting!";"";"";
4de69;"Thanks for your concern, but
really, I'll be fine in just
a moment. This happens a lot.";"";"";
4dec7;"I always give the apples I pick
to the other villagers.";"";"";
4df05;"Apples are quite popular
here in Lance Village.";"";"";
4df3b;"Remind me, sometime, and I'll show
you where the best apple trees can

for you to go outside?";"";"";
4dfcb;"Leonor said you'd be fine, but I
couldn't help being worried until
I saw your recovery with my own eyes!";"";"";
4e03b;"...Thank goodness!";"";"";

They say one each day keeps Dr.

you where the best apple trees can

4e0fd;"I picked it myself.";"";"";
4e117;"Eeeek! The demons...
They've come to Lance!";"";"";
4e149;"Man, just...look around! The clouds are
so high, I've got an amazing view of the
world below, like never before...";"";"";
4e1c3;"I think I'll stay in here, thanks!";"";"";

4e229;"I think I'll stay in here, thanks!";"";"";
4e253;"Are the demons really out
hunting for human flesh...?";"";"";
4e28f;"Not that that's a bad thing! We used to
always hear whispered voices...and some
kind of bell, too, recently.";"";"";
4e303;"It's been pretty quiet
underground, lately.";"";"";
4e335;"If you ask me, it's in Gila's basement.
That place gives me the creeps like you
wouldn't believe!";"";"";
4e39d;"Granny Lucille said she
sensed something evil...";"";"";
4e3d5;"It's been pretty quiet
underground, lately.";"";"";
4e407;"Am I going crazy, or is there
something happening beneath the
streets of Lance Village?";"";"";
4e465;"And the other noises have been
a lot louder than before, too.";"";"";
4e4a9;"Been hearing this faint sound of
a bell ringing coming from somewhere
beneath my feet lately...";"";"";
4e50f;"What we need is a bell to keep
them away, NOT draw them in...";"";"";
4e553;"There's a rumor going around that
it's the sound of some bell used
to summon demons.";"";"";
4e5af;"Have you heard the ringing sound
coming from beneath the village?";"";"";
4e5f7;"Huh, it's a Roo. Don't see
those around here too often!";"";"";
4e635;"Ys has rejoined the world below?
How...ominous...";"";"";
4e66d;"I asked Astal and Leggs if they saw
her, but I guess she managed to give
them the slip. I sure hope she's okay...";"";"";
4e6e5;"Banoa must be so worried...";"";"";
4e707;"Lilia went out to the ruins,
and that's the last anyone's
seen of her.";"";"";
4e755;"If you really are some kind of savior,
then won't you please use that power of
yours to get rid of the demons?";"";"";
4e7cb;"He told me you're supposed to be the
savior of this land, led here by the
Goddesses themselves.";"";"";
4e831;"I was just talking to Leggs.";"";"";
4e855;"If you're looking for Leggs, he's
gone back to the ruins. You'll find
him there, without a doubt.";"";"";
4e8bd;"Just who are you, anyway?";"";"";
4e8dd;"He seems really worked up over
something. And he usually only gets
excited like that about the Goddesses!";"";"";
4e94d;"Adol, right? Your red hair is a dead
giveaway. Leggs was just looking for
you. Go see him, when you have a moment.";"";"";
4e9c7;"I swear, he's in love with that Goddess
statue. I don't know what he does with
it all day, and I don't WANT to know!";"";"";
4ea43;"Leggs was in the ruins of Moondoria,
eh? Yeah, THERE'S a shocker...";"";"";
4ea8d;"In fact, I'll bet he's off at the
ruins again right now, staring at
that Goddess statue all creepily...";"";"";
4eafb;"Leggs is always going on
and on about it...";"";"";
4eb2d;"I heard there used to be six kinds
of magic in Ys, one handed down by
each of the six Priests.";"";"";
4eb93;"...Most likely me.";"";"";
4ebad;"You want a fight? You steppin'?!
Somebody's gonna get hurt, yo!";"";"";
4ebf3;"It's like we've fallen back to the
surface world...";"";"";
4ec2d;"Am I...hallucinating or something?
It looks like the ground now stretches
off into the sky, past the edges of Ys.";"";"";
4eca5;"I'm still worried about Lilia,
but at least we know that Bohtz
is alive and well.";"";"";
4ecfd;"It's hard to believe, but he says all
the people who were kidnapped were taken
to the big shrine above the ice ridge!";"";"";
4ed79;"Have you heard? Bohtz is back,
safe and sound!";"";"";
4edaf;"We've had a peaceful life here in Ys
for so many centuries... Why are all
these calamities happening now?!";"";"";
4ee21;"And Bohtz hasn't come back from
Rasteenie Mine, either...";"";"";
4ee61;"Have you heard? Apparently,
Lilia just...vanished...
without a trace!";"";"";
4eead;"But...she's doing better now, right?";"";"";
4eed9;"I heard Lilia was really sick...";"";"";
4ef01;"Apparently, he also gathered
a few more much-needed herbs,
which is excellent news.";"";"";
4ef5b;"Lazlo seems ecstatic to have finally
gotten his hands on some iron ore
again, after all this time.";"";"";
4efc5;"Astal is standing guard
at the entrance.";"";"";
4eff5;"The Rasteenie Mine is practically a
death trap these days, so no one can
enter without the elder's permission.";"";"";
4f06b;"The lack of ore and the monsters
alike are causing no end of grief
for Bohtz and the other miners.";"";"";
4f0d5;"It was closed a long time ago when the
ore deposits started drying up. And then
six months ago, the demons showed up...";"";"";
4f153;"There's an old mine under
the Ruins of Moondoria.";"";"";
4f18b;"I wonder if the demons
really speak their own
language...";"";"";
4f1cb;"...Why aren't you more excited?!";"";"";
4f1f3;"Ys is back on solid ground, after
what...seven hundred years? I saw
it with my own two eyes!";"";"";
4f257;"So I'm sure you've heard, but if you're
anything like me, you probably don't
believe it. It's really true, though...";"";"";
4f2d3;"...Well, hopefully, anyway.";"";"";
4f2f5;"I don't know how to thank you.
Finally, at long last, I'll be
able to get some sleep!";"";"";
4f351;"Hey, did you really kill all
the demons in Gila's basement?";"";"";
4f393;"Have you noticed it's been
getting warmer lately?";"";"";
4f3cb;"Temperature increases...demonic voices
from underground... Yeah, I think I'm
going to interpret these as ill omens!";"";"";
4f445;"Hey, have you noticed it's
been getting warmer lately?";"";"";
4f483;"Which reminds me...I should get
some sleep right now! I'm BEAT!";"";"";
4f4c9;"I don't know how to thank you.
Finally, at long last, I'll be
able to get some sleep!";"";"";
4f525;"Hey, did you really kill all
the demons in Gila's basement?";"";"";
4f567;"Rumor has it the demons are specifically
hunting human beings, though I really,
REALLY hope that's just panic talking.";"";"";
4f5e5;"There's been a sharp increase in the
number of disappearances recently. Just
one more thing to worry about, I guess!";"";"";
4f661;"What is this world coming to?
Isn't there anything anyone can
do about all this?!";"";"";
4f6b9;"Add to that all the recent talk of
demons going out and actively hunting
for humans, and yeah...rest easy? Ha!";"";"";
4f72f;"Sometimes when I go to bed at night,
I hear this dreadful wailing from
deep beneath the ground.";"";"";
4f795;"And they're gone! HURRAH!
Full night of restful sleep,
here I (hopefully) come!";"";"";
4f7eb;"...So I was right! It WAS demons!";"";"";
4f813;"Hey, did you really kill all
the demons in Gila's basement?";"";"";
4f855;"If only someone would find
them and take them out...";"";"";
4f891;"...Don't know why I think that.
But I do. I just...have a gut
feeling about it.";"";"";
4f8e7;"It's demons! I just know it!
Demons lurking in every nook
and cranny under this village!";"";"";
4f947;"Sometimes when I go to bed at night,
I hear this dreadful wailing from
deep beneath the ground.";"";"";
4f9ad;"If only someone would find

4fa9f;"Sometimes when I go to bed at night,
I hear this dreadful wailing from
deep beneath the ground.";"";"";
4fb05;"I haven't had a good night's sleep
in WEEKS. If this doesn't stop soon,
I swear I'm going to lose it...";"";"";
4fb73;"Maybe it's all in my head,
but it just seems so REAL...";"";"";
4fbb1;"...When I go to bed at night, I hear the
most dreadful screaming and clattering
coming from beneath the village.";"";"";
4fc29;"Hey, can I tell you something?
Just between you and me? Swear
you won't tell another soul?";"";"";
4fc8b;"Bite me and you're dead.";"";"";
4fcab;"I've got special armor on.";"";"";
4fccd;"I wish I could make armor again, but
I've got no metal to use-- and no,
pikkard-skin doesn't work, believe me!";"";"";
4fd43;"I haven't been able to go down into
the mine to look for iron ore since
the demons showed up.";"";"";
4fda7;"This is driving me crazy.";"";"";
4fdc7;"You wanna get in the pen?";"";"";

have somehow gotten past my
son, Larsen.";"";"";
5031d;"I think this may be the day I've
been waiting for all this time...";"";"";
50367;"I haven't seen it for myself yet,
but I've heard... Ys has fallen
back to the surface. Back home.";"";"";
503cf;"And what will become of Ys...?";"";"";
503f5;"Demons everywhere, people vanishing...
What is happening to this world?";"";"";
50443;"I sense that the evil presence
there has been vanquished. There
is no longer any threat.";"";"";
504a3;"I see...so Gila's basement
really was infested with
demons?";"";"";
504e5;"We can't just leave them like that...
They could come up into the village and
cause all manner of trouble!";"";"";
50557;"By the Goddesses, do you mean to tell
me there really ARE demons living in
Gila's basement?!";"";"";
505bb;"I hate to be a pessimist, but
what if there are demons down
there?!";"";"";
50605;"I feel an evil presence in
Gila's basement...";"";"";
50639;"I'm disgusting. All tough, and
stringy... Not fit for monster
consumption in any way, I swear!";"";"";
5069f;"I wonder if there's anyone left to
spread it TO, though. Most have likely
begun to notice by now, as I should've!";"";"";
50717;"It's not just some baseless rumor? It
actually happened?! ...By the Goddesses,
I need to go out and spread the word!";"";"";
50793;"Whoa, whoa, whoa... Do you mean
to tell me that Ys actually DID
return to the surface?!";"";"";
507f1;"...NOT! Haha, I had you going there for
a moment! To believe such a preposterous
rumor... Ah, the naivete of youth!";"";"";
5086b;"Just between you and me...I hear
tell that Ys will be falling back
to the surface soon...";"";"";
508cb;"Have you noticed that it's been
getting warmer lately?";"";"";
50909;"But we mustn't discount the possibility.
Supposedly, the hunted are being taken
away to some undisclosed location...";"";"";
50985;"No? ...A second rumor states that demons
have been hunting humans who leave this
place. Hopefully JUST a rumor, that!";"";"";
50a01;"There's a rumor going around that
Lilia followed you out of the
village. Have you seen her?";"";"";
50a63;"So, it really does exist! It seems
rumors around here tend toward
validity...";"";"";
50ab7;"That tablet you're holding...
That's not the one I was telling
you about, is it?";"";"";
50b0f;"But remember, you wouldn't know about
it if it weren't for me. So I'll be
expecting a cut of the loot!";"";"";
50b7d;"With that tablet, you might be able
to learn something useful about the
Sanctuary of Toal.";"";"";
50bdf;"So, it really does exist! It seems
rumors around here tend toward
validity...";"";"";
50c33;"Wait... That tablet in your hands is the
one I was just talking about, isn't it?
Is that why you're grinning at me?!";"";"";
50caf;"Supposedly, it details a mystical
location known as the 'Sanctuary
of Toal.'";"";"";
50d03;"I hear a lot of rumors, and one speaks
of an old stone tablet enshrined within
the Ruins of Moondoria.";"";"";
50d71;"But remember, you wouldn't be looking
for it if not for my advice. So be sure
to share any treasures you find with me!";"";"";
50def;"If you had that tablet, you might
be able to learn something useful
about the Sanctuary of Toal.";"";"";

goal to set in your adventure, if you
should feel so inclined.";"";"";

of Toal.'";"";"";
50f19;"I hear a lot of rumors, and one speaks

the Ruins of Moondoria.";"";"";
50f87;"It's a d-d-d-d-d-MONSTER!";"";"";
50fa7;"Has our little floating island
really turned into a big over-
world now? I wanna see, I wanna see!";"";"";
51011;"But where did she go...?";"";"";
51031;"I think you and Lilia are on
the right track, mister!";"";"";
5106d;"I wonder where Lilia went...";"";"";
51091;"Wow, you really saved
Lilia? Thanks, mister!";"";"";
510c5;"That's pretty cool!
Maybe I had you pegged
all wrong!";"";"";
51101;"Are you the one who
rescued Dr. Rall,
mister?";"";"";
51135;"That's pretty impressive,
mister...but don't you go
getting a big head over it!";"";"";
5118b;"Whoa... You killed that
demon in the old mine?";"";"";
511c1;"There's s'posed to be a real
big one in the ruins. One that
can't be hurt by normal weapons.";"";"";
51225;"If you haven't wiped out all the
demons there, though, then you don't
get bragging rights just yet!";"";"";
5128f;"Hmm. You went to
Moondoria, huh?";"";"";
512b7;"'Far, far away'? Mister, there's nothing
far from here! Just because I'm a kid,
do you think I'm stupid or something?!";"";"";
51335;"I haven't seen you before,
mister... Where are you
from?";"";"";
51375;"Eeyaargh!";"";"";
51385;"Does this mean I can go farther
away when I want to play now?!";"";"";
513cb;"Oh, wow... Oh, wow!
I can't believe Ys is
on the ground now!";"";"";
5140f;"You gotta go look for her, okay?
You just gotta!";"";"";
51447;"Lilia's gone...and I dunno
where she went!";"";"";
51479;"Now she can come play
with me again! Yaaay!";"";"";
514ab;"Lilia got all better!
That's soooo cool!";"";"";
514db;"Awesome... Awesome!";"";"";
514f5;"Dr. Rall's been rescued!
That's soooo cool!";"";"";
51527;"Awesome... Awesome!";"";"";
51541;"You're on an adventure
to find Dr. Rall?
That's soooo cool!";"";"";
51583;"Awesome... Awesome!";"";"";
5159d;"That tablet's soooo cool!";"";"";
515bd;"Awesome... Awesome!";"";"";
515d7;"Those books you've got
are soooo cool!";"";"";
51605;"Awesome... Awesome!";"";"";
5161f;"You look positively scrumptious,
my little furry friend!";"";"";
5165f;"(Might be good smoked and cured...)";"";"";
51689;"The below-lands are really warm! And...
not below anymore! I wonder if they have
pikkards in this strange new world...";"";"";
51707;"I know what you're gonna say.
That Ys fell to the surface.
And that it's soooo cool.";"";"";
51763;"*sigh* She's such a goofball...";"";"";
51789;"My sister sings this weird little
song whenever she goes to look
after the pikkards.";"";"";
517e5;"If she's still attached to them once
they're all fat and juicy, she is NOT
going to like what happens next...";"";"";
51859;"That little twerp says she's
going to name one after me,
though...";"";"";
518a3;"I've been letting my little sister,
Lucy, name all the newborn pikkards.";"";"";
518f3;"So...we're raising them here.
And my annoying little sister
likes to keep an eye on them!";"";"";
51953;"But with all the demons running
around these days, I can't put
them out to pasture anymore.";"";"";
519b5;"Hey, I'm Theo. I raise
pikkards here.";"";"";
519e1;"Eeek?!";"";"";
519ef;"The sunlight feels different... The air
TASTES different... Really, nothing at
all is the same!";"";"";
51a55;"So, this is...well, the world!";"";"";
51a7b;"I can't even hazard a guess
as to what it all means...";"";"";
51ab9;"The clouds seem like they're right
up alongside us, and the wind feels
a lot calmer...";"";"";
51b17;"The sky's been looking real
peculiar lately.";"";"";
51b4b;"As for the rest of us...
All we can do is pray.";"";"";
51b81;"...She probably ran AFTER you, though.
So Adol, please... Try to find her!
You may very well be her only hope!";"";"";
51bf7;"I was worried that she might have run
off with a certain someone, but you're
not smiling big enough for that!";"";"";
51c6b;"Adol... Lilia's gone. She
just up and vanished!";"";"";
51ca1;"I hear Lilia's been sick.
I didn't even know...";"";"";
51cd7;"I promise I won't tell anyone
else! C'mon! Just between us!";"";"";
51d19;"Which begs the question...
How do you REALLY feel
about her?";"";"";
51d5d;"I hear that you went really
deep into the abandoned mine
on her behalf.";"";"";
51dab;"Thank you for helping
Lilia, Adol.";"";"";
51dd5;"Also...the demons rarely leave
the ruins, but you never can be
too careful, so stay alert!";"";"";
51e37;"I'd stay away from the cliff edge
if I were you, though. No one can
possibly catch you if you fall!";"";"";
51ea1;"On a nice day like this, there's
nothing like a nice, simple walk
through the field.";"";"";
51efd;"Good morning. It's another
lovely day, isn't it?";"";"";
51f35;"And you, you're not so bad-looking
yourself! You never know... You two
might be a match made in heaven!";"";"";
51fa3;"Haha... You know, she's a very
pretty young lady. And as sweet
as a bucket of sugar!";"";"";
51fff;"You look well. Feeling better,
I take it? Lilia was worried sick
about you!";"";"";
52051;"You're the traveler who's been
staying at Lilia's house, no?";"";"";
52095;"Animals have it so easy.
Not a care in the world!";"";"";
520cd;"*siiiiiigh*";"";"";
520df;"I wasn't sighing at all!
Just, um, taking in the
fresh air! Yeah, that's it!";"";"";
52133;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?";"";"";
52159;"*siiiiiigh*";"";"";
5216b;"Second loves are where it's at!";"";"";
52191;"I suppose that's just one
of life's little lessons.";"";"";
521cb;"Well, ever heard the saying, 'Nothing
ever comes of first loves'? Yeah...
It's totally true.";"";"";
5222f;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?";"";"";
52255;"*siiiiiigh*";"";"";
52267;"Someday, you'll experience
it too. And on that day...
you will feel my pain.";"";"";
522bb;"...Hey, don't look at
me like that!";"";"";
522e5;"I'm telling you, I'd die for her!";"";"";
5230d;"She's like an angel
in a white robe...";"";"";
5233b;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?
Well, why does ANYONE sigh?
Unrequited love, of course!";"";"";
52399;"*siiiiiigh*";"";"";
523ab;"I'm not willing to risk it, though.
Not with all those demons around!";"";"";
523f7;"It was divinely scrumptious. If I could
eat just one more in my lifetime, then
I feel as if I could die happy.";"";"";
5246d;"I was just thinking about the
heavenly taste of that Roda
Fruit I found in the ruins once...";"";"";
524d1;"Hmm? Why am I sighing, you ask?";"";"";
524f7;"*siiiiiigh*";"";"";
52509;"Can't I just pledge my devotion
to you, in exchange for you not
killing me...?";"";"";
5255f;"I...I don't wanna die!";"";"";
5257d;"Yikes!";"";"";
5258b;"Doesn't the air feel...odd to you?
I feel so at peace right now...
and it's like the wind does, too!";"";"";
525f7;"It's not safe for a
young girl to be by
herself out there...";"";"";
5263b;"Just when she's been cured of
her sickness, she up and
vanishes!";"";"";
52683;"Ah, Adol. Have you seen Lilia?";"";"";
526a9;"I'm so very relieved. Your
devotion is...inspirational!";"";"";
526e7;"Lilia's going to make it.
And it's all thanks to you.";"";"";
52723;"First she saves you, and now, you
save her. It's like a storybook
romance!";"";"";
52775;"Quickly, go deliver the
medicine. Banoa will be
overjoyed!";"";"";
527b7;"I give you...my devotion!";"";"";
527d7;"...Well, I have ONE thing,
I suppose...";"";"";
52805;"...Which I mean quite literally.
I'd LIKE to offer you a token of my
thanks, but I have nothing to give!";"";"";
52875;"I really appreciate what you did
for my brother. I'd like to offer
you a token of my thanks.";"";"";
528d9;"All I can offer is my devotion.";"";"";
528ff;"I am but a humble caregiver.";"";"";
52923;"I'm sorry... I don't have
anything tangible to give.";"";"";
5295f;"You're already up and about?
You must heal quickly. If only
we were ALL so lucky!";"";"";
529b7;"Hey there, Adol.";"";"";
529cf;"I do hope he comes back soon...";"";"";
529f5;"My brother went to gather herbs,
but he has yet to return.";"";"";
52a37;"I'm studying to become a doctor, but for
the moment, I am merely an apprentice. A
caregiver, if you will. With devotion.";"";"";
52ab7;"...Can you even understand
what I'm saying? Do you speak
our language?";"";"";
52b05;"I have a wife and two
young daughters.";"";"";
52b33;"Please, spare me.";"";"";
52b4b;"Whatever happens next, it won't be as
bad as a kidnapping by demons. I can
think of no worse fate!";"";"";
52bb5;"Go on, you should get back
to the village. Banoa will be
delighted to see you!";"";"";
52c0b;"Thank goodness! Where did you
go after you disappeared down
in that canal?";"";"";
52c5d;"Lilia's been found?!";"";"";
52c79;"I have a wife and two daughters at
home, you see, so I simply can't
afford to risk my life like that!";"";"";
52ce5;"Because of the demons in the mine, I
haven't been able to get in there to
restock iron ore OR medicinal herbs.";"";"";
52d5b;"Oh, dear... I just don't know what to
do. I don't think I can face either Dr.
Flair or Lazlo, as things stand.";"";"";
52dd1;"Maybe it's a portent of good
fortune for the village.";"";"";
52e11;"Ah, a Roo. It's rare to see one
of your kind around here...and
usually, it's a good omen.";"";"";
52e75;"Ys is no different. It is
returning to the spot where
it belongs...";"";"";
52ec3;"Everything is coming full circle.
All things inevitably wind up
where they are meant to be.";"";"";
52f29;"Has the time come, at long
last, for Ys to return to
the surface...?";"";"";
52f79;"The sky is different than I
remember it. Could Ys perhaps
be losing altitude?";"";"";
52fd1;"It's little comfort, but it's all I
have. So I'm going to believe that
wherever she is, she is all right.";"";"";
53045;"...I suppose she did manage to beat a
serious illness, though, so perhaps
fortune favors her...";"";"";
530af;"Where could she have run off to?
The demons are everywhere... She
shouldn't be out there by herself!";"";"";
5311f;"Oh, Adol... It's terrible.
Lilia's gone missing!";"";"";
5315b;"You were brought here for a
reason, Adol Christin. It is
up to you to decipher it.";"";"";
531b9;"I'm sure your destiny will become
clear forthwith, along with the
purpose of those powers granted you.";"";"";
5322b;"So, you've returned all the
Books of Ys, have you?";"";"";
53269;"Perhaps we should form
a search party...";"";"";
5329d;"So you've returned all the books,
have you? But still no sign of Dr.
Flair? Troubling news, indeed...";"";"";
5330d;"Go! That book must be returned
if anything is to come of this!";"";"";
53357;"...Wait, you still haven't
returned the book? What are
you waiting for?!";"";"";
533ab;"Ahh, so Gila's basement is connected
to the sanctuary of Priest Fact? That
does explain things!";"";"";
53415;"Hmmm... No luck finding
Priest Fact's sanctuary,
you say?";"";"";
53459;"I believe Lance Village was once
part of Moondoria, so perhaps the
clue may lie right under our feet...";"";"";
534cb;"There must be a
clue somewhere!";"";"";
534f5;"What could it mean? I rather
doubt it's located anywhere
else...";"";"";
53541;"When all six books have been returned
to the Priests, you may learn the
nature of your destiny here in Ys.";"";"";
535b7;"I would recommend you visit these
rooms, and return the Books of Ys
to the hands of their writers.";"";"";
53625;"Statues of the Priests have been
erected within these rooms.";"";"";
5366d;"There are a series of rooms in the
Rasteenie Mine which are collectively
known as the 'Sanctuary of Toal.'";"";"";
536e3;"As Elder of this village, you
have my sincerest thanks.";"";"";
53725;"Oh, Adol! I'm told you brought
Dr. Flair back to us, alive and
unharmed.";"";"";
53779;"Anyway...I understand you have six
ancient books with you. Might I
please have a look at them?";"";"";
537e3;"Maybe I was just hallucinating...";"";"";
5380f;"Without thinking, I began tailing
them for a short while...but then,
they simply disappeared!";"";"";
53877;"I would have asked them their names,
but I was taken aback by their beauty.
They looked just like the Goddesses...";"";"";
538f5;"I was walking in the ruins the other day
when I crossed ways with a pair of young
girls. Were they also from the surface?";"";"";
53979;"My name is Cornell. I serve as this
village's elder. And I actually have
a question for you...";"";"";
539e3;"Ah, you must be the man Lilia
found out in the field. Adol,
was it?";"";"";
53a31;"#c2#Adol showed the Books of Ys
to the elder.";"";"";
53a65;"A man named Astal stands guard there,
but if you tell him that I've given my
blessing, he'll let you through.";"";"";
53add;"The entrance to Rasteenie Mine
is in the Ruins of Moondoria,
to the north of the village.";"";"";
53b41;"When all six books have been returned
to the Priests, you may learn the
nature of your destiny here in Ys.";"";"";
53bb7;"I believe your next course of action
should be to return the books to the
hands of these statues.";"";"";
53c23;"There is a place in the Rasteenie Mine
known as the Sanctuary of Toal, where a
statue of each Priest has been erected.";"";"";
53ca5;"Each holds the thoughts
and memories of one of
the six Priests.";"";"";
53cef;"These may very well serve as proof
that the Priests themselves have
guided you here to Ys.";"";"";
53d55;"Hmm... Yes, there's no doubt about it.
These are the books that the Priests of
Ys handed down to their descendants.";"";"";
53dd3;"But do be careful. I'm sure you'll hear
this a lot, but it's true: You may very
well be our only hope, Adol Christin!";"";"";
53e53;"You should have no trouble,
I'd think. After all, the
Priests are guiding you!";"";"";
53ead;"Will you be going to his aid?";"";"";
53ed5;"...What? Flair's been involved
in an accident in the mine?!
That's terrible news!";"";"";
53f31;"When all six books have been returned
to the Priests, you may learn the
nature of your destiny here in Ys.";"";"";
53fa7;"I would recommend you visit these
rooms, and return the Books of Ys
to the hands of their writers.";"";"";
54015;"Statues of the Priests have been
erected within these rooms.";"";"";
5405d;"There are a series of rooms in the
Rasteenie Mine which are collectively
known as the Sanctuary of Toal.";"";"";
540d1;"Did you get in while I was napping
earlier?! Dammit, I need to sleep
with one eye open from now on!";"";"";
5413b;"Crap! The demons have infiltrated
the village! Everybody, RUN!";"";"";
54181;"There used to be an endless expanse
of blue sky, but now it's land and
water, as far as the eye can see...";"";"";
541f3;"It's hard for me to accept that
Ys is now back on the surface.";"";"";
54239;"Perhaps it's a harbinger of
things to come...";"";"";
5426d;"Something's looked a bit off
with them for the last little
while, though.";"";"";
542bd;"If you look at the horizon from
here, you can get a good view
of the clouds floating by.";"";"";
5431d;"I hope she's safe,
wherever she is...";"";"";
54349;"And Astal hasn't seen her,
so we really have no leads
on where she might have gone.";"";"";
543a3;"Old man Leggs was in the village on the
day Lilia vanished, so only Astal was
actually out in the ruins at the time.";"";"";
5441f;"Adol, right? Excellent work,
Adol! I don't know what we'd
do if we ever lost Lilia.";"";"";
54479;"You must be the guy!";"";"";
54495;"Wait...
Red hair...";"";"";
544af;"I only found out when I heard that a
red-haired traveler somehow got his
hands on the medicine's ingredients.";"";"";
54523;"I had no idea that Lilia
was even sick.";"";"";
54551;"Though nice weather makes me really
sleepy. But don't worry! I won't nod
off, I swear! ...Not for long, anyway...";"";"";
545c9;"You can count on me to keep
the village safe. I pledge
my life to Lance!";"";"";
54619;"I swear, Adol, you're getting stronger
by the second. Best watch out, or you'll
wind up a gibbering mass of muscles!";"";"";
54695;"So, you rescued Dr. Flair,
did you? Very nicely done!";"";"";
546d1;"The mine was closed a pretty long time
ago, so it's gotten kind of difficult
to find one's way around in there.";"";"";
54747;"Doctor Flair was injured in
Rasteenie Mine? How awful!";"";"";
54785;"Have you met old
man Leggs?";"";"";
547a7;"He's in pretty good shape
for a man his age.";"";"";
547db;"Leggs really loves Moondoria,
for whatever reason. He's out
there every single day.";"";"";
54835;"I'm keeping watch over the
village, to make sure the
demons don't get in.";"";"";

be too careful!";"";"";

56ecd;"The Goddesses are at the end of this
passageway, and Gorto is waiting for
you a bit farther ahead. Please hurry!";"";"";
56f45;"What are you doing? You need to hurry!";"";"";
56f73;"Good to see your hair's still red. I was
afraid it might have gone gray by now!";"";"";
56fc9;"Go on ahead. The Goddesses await!
We'll be right behind you.";"";"";
5700d;"The Goddesses are beyond this barrier,
most likely...but I have no idea how we
can possibly get through.";"";"";
5707d;"Hey, good to see you, Adol! It's me,
Gorto, from Ramia!";"";"";
570bb;"In my dream, one of the two girls
who appeared to me was wearing that
on her finger...";"";"";
57119;"Wait... Is that...the Goddess Ring?";"";"";
57143;"Give it a shot, man!";"";"";
5715f;"If anything can break the barrier, it's
that, right there!";"";"";
571a1;"Damn it! We've come so far! What do we
do now?!";"";"";
571d7;"The Goddesses are beyond this barrier,
most likely...but I have no idea how we
can possibly get through.";"";"";
57247;"Hey, good to see you, Adol! It's me,
Gorto, from Ramia!";"";"";
57285;"Damn it! We've come so far! What do we
do now?";"";"";
572bb;"Hey, did you see something move over
there? What could it have been? Was
it...a demon...?";"";"";
5731b;"What in the world is a Roo
doing in a place like this?";"";"";
57359;"Don't worry about me. I'll be
fine here. You go on ahead and
fulfill your destiny!";"";"";
573b3;"Doesn't seem like there are any
demons around here, so I think
I'll just sit tight for a bit.";"";"";
57417;"Perhaps that ring has the power to
destroy the demons' barrier...";"";"";
5745f;"Adol?!";"";"";
5746d;"My goodness! It's so great to see that
you're all right!";"";"";
574ad;"I'm sorry if I made you worry.";"";"";
574d3;"After I was turned back, I got an
overwhelming urge to see you-- as
if I were being drawn here!";"";"";
57539;"Clearly, you're the one they meant. So
please, take this ring. I believe it
will be crucial in your quest!";"";"";
575ab;"They said, 'If you find the one you
seek, please give this to him.'";"";"";
575f5;"When I was searching for you in
the Subterranean Canal, I met two
girls, and they gave it to me.";"";"";
5765d;"...I was able to come all this way
without any demons spotting me, and
I believe this ring made it possible.";"";"";
576d1;"And before I knew it, here I was!";"";"";
576f9;"But that's not the only reason...
I just felt like I needed to be
useful in some way.";"";"";
57755;"A black shadow was seen
darting off up ahead.";"";"";
57789;"Someone was just here!";"";"";
577a7;"W-what's that you
say? I d-d-don't
understand...";"";"";
577df;"You're all red...
Wipe that blood off
your cranium!";"";"";
57819;"Over there... That fallen fruit...
I-it tastes so good, it does!";"";"";
57861;"Don't talk to me.
I-I'm in a bad mood!";"";"";
5788f;"Perhaps you have some interest
in me, since you keep coming to
talk. Are you...a fan?";"";"";
578eb;"Heeheehee! Hoohoohoo!
Haahaahaa! Hwahwahwa!
Harharhar! Chachacha!";"";"";
57933;"Have you seen any
tasty-looking humans
around here?";"";"";
5796d;"Laaaahahahahaughing
is fuuuuuuhuhuhun!";"";"";
5799b;"Blood... Give me blood!";"";"";
579b9;"...What do YOU want?";"";"";
579d5;"I wonder what used
to be inside...?";"";"";
579ff;"I don't see the point of
guarding an empty box...";"";"";
57a37;"Feels like my body's
gradually turning to
stone.";"";"";
57a6f;"I'm...busy...right now...
Come...back...later....";"";"";
57aa7;"Skronk, skronk, SHAFA-KOOM!";"";"";
57ac9;"Hmmm... You LOOK like a
demon, but something about
you seems human...";"";"";
57b15;"And I shall watch the story unfold
from my vantage point here. Best of
luck to you, brave soul!";"";"";
57b7b;"Whether the new era will be one of
peace or one of suffering...is entirely
in your hands, Adol Christin.";"";"";
57beb;"With the descent of Ys to the surface,
a 700-year-long era comes to a close.
Doesn't the majesty of it overwhelm you?";"";"";
57c67;"Hero, under guidance of the twin Goddes-
ses...have you reflected upon this grand
adventure, now that it nears its end?";"";"";
57ce5;"Your path will surely
become clear.";"";"";
57d0f;"You will soon receive the answers
you seek. Steel your courage, and
prepare to face the truth of the world.";"";"";
57d81;"Humans and demons...
and magic...make up
this land of Ys.";"";"";
57dc1;"Your path will surely
become clear.";"";"";
57deb;"Steel your courage and prepare
to face the truth of the world.";"";"";
57e31;"The path laid before you holds
the answers you seek.";"";"";
57e6d;"I'm sure that you will worry, regardless
of what I say...but whatever happens is
what was meant to be.";"";"";
57edb;"Lilia has simply disappeared.";"";"";
57eff;"But don't let this one success get
to your head. Before your quest is
over, there is much more to be done!";"";"";
57f71;"Ahh, so you aided in curing
Lilia of her sickness? Very
nicely done!";"";"";
57fbd;"Your path will surely
become clear.";"";"";
57fe7;"Steel your courage and prepare
to face the truth of the world.";"";"";
5802d;"But don't let this one success get
to your head. Before your quest is
over, there is much more to be done!";"";"";
5809f;"Very nicely done!";"";"";
580b7;"Ahh, so you defeated that demon
deep in the mine, did you?";"";"";
580f9;"Your path will surely
become clear.";"";"";
58123;"Steel your courage and prepare
to face the truth of the world.";"";"";
58169;"But don't let this one success get
to your head. Before your quest is
over, there is much more to be done!";"";"";
581db;"Ahh, so you rescued Dr. Flair Rall,
did you? Very nicely done!";"";"";
58221;"Your path will surely
become clear.";"";"";
5824b;"Steel your courage and prepare
to face the truth of the world.";"";"";
58291;"...But you've proven to be an
honest-to-goodness hero. A real
credit to the Goddesses' names.";"";"";
582f5;"At first, I had you pegged
for just another shiftless
young man...";"";"";
5833f;"Your path will surely
become clear.";"";"";
58369;"The Goddesses walk with you, I sense.
Steel your courage and prepare to face
the truth of the world.";"";"";
583d5;"The power of the Priests may be the
key to exceeding your own limits, and
accomplishing superhuman feats.";"";"";
58445;"Finding them is of the utmost
import. They will no doubt prove
essential to your goal.";"";"";
584a3;"The six forms of magic that the
Priests once used still exist
somewhere in Ys.";"";"";
584f9;"Swordsman...";"";"";
5850d;"It's just what I always assumed
would be in that treasure chest!";"";"";
58555;"Swordsman... That which you
hold is none other than the
Rod of Divinity.";"";"";
585a5;"From this point on, your
magic power shall surely
show you the way!";"";"";
585ef;"If you touch the Rod upon the Goddess
statue, I believe you will receive the
ability to use magic.";"";"";
58659;"The Rod of Divinity signifies one who is
worthy to lead. The magic of the Priests
shall be inherited only by its bearer.";"";"";
586d9;"The statue up ahead
represents the two
Goddesses of Ys.";"";"";
58717;"My name, believe it or not, is
Leggs. But you may call me the
Leg-Man, if you so desire!";"";"";
58777;"Ahh, wait, I know! You're the
boy Banoa was looking after.
Adol, was it?";"";"";
587c7;"Hehh? Who might you be?!";"";"";
587e7;"Even I don't come out here
without a Short Sword...and
I know this area well!";"";"";
5883b;"Do you have a death wish?";"";"";
5885b;"No weapon? In THESE ruins?!
You're a loon, young man!";"";"";
58897;"Here, I have a spare one
I can give you. Take it,
please! You'll need it!";"";"";
588e7;"...If you believe you can, I'd ask that
you defeat the demons over yonder, and
bring me the treasure they guard.";"";"";
5895f;"Still, your sword alone may not
be enough to defeat all of the
enemies who stand before you.";"";"";
589c3;"You seem to have some
considerable sword
experience.";"";"";
589ff;"...No, best if I don't. You're not
yet strong enough to handle the
power of the Priests.";"";"";
58a5f;"You look like like a swordsman
of some skill. As such, I have
a favor to ask of you...";"";"";
58abd;"Hmm? Oh, it's a Roo. Where
did you come from, little
fellow?";"";"";
58b05;"It's easy to see: All I need to do
is look to the sky. Everything seems
so much farther away...";"";"";
58b6b;"...I understand that Ys has
fallen back to the surface.";"";"";
58ba9;"Hey, Adol.";"";"";
58bbb;"It's just hard to keep a positive
attitude, under the circumstances.
I'm trying...but it's very hard.";"";"";
58c2b;"And I'm sure she IS fine,
wherever she is.";"";"";
58c61;"Banoa told me to keep my
spirits up about Lilia.";"";"";
58c9d;"Lilia possesses good fortune to have
overcome her illness...and I believe
that fortune will see her through.";"";"";
58d15;"Perhaps my mind had wandered.
If only I'd been paying closer
attention...";"";"";
58d69;"Apparently, Lilia came here, and
now she's missing. But I certainly
didn't see her...";"";"";
58dc9;"If anything happens to Lilia,
I take full responsibility for
it. I'm so very, very sorry...";"";"";
58e2f;"Brrr! Gives me the chills,
just thinking about it!";"";"";
58e6d;"...What?! HOW big?! My goodness...
To think there'd be such a massive
creature beneath my feet all this time!";"";"";
58ee5;"Old man Leggs says he can't
sense any evil presence coming
from the mine anymore...";"";"";
58f43;"I just wish the other
demons around here
would follow suit...";"";"";
58f8b;"I'm so glad you vanquished the
fiend from Rasteenie Mine.";"";"";
58fcf;"Outstanding!";"";"";
58fe7;"Dr. Flair told me he was rescued
by a red-haired boy. I take it he
was referring to you, then?";"";"";
59051;"I'm quite impressed that you
were able to rescue Dr. Flair
from the abandoned mine.";"";"";
590af;"And even then...it's usually
just Dr. Flair himself. So do
be careful down there, okay?";"";"";
59111;"The villagers don't go down
there at all anymore, save for
when they need medicinal herbs.";"";"";
59177;"There are a lot of demons
roaming the abandoned Rasteenie
Mine these days...";"";"";
591cf;"You got the elder's permission?
...All right. Can't argue with
that! You're free to go in.";"";"";
59235;"Hey, you look confused.
Is something the matter?";"";"";
59271;"You're Adol, right? It's good
to see you're feeling better!";"";"";
592b7;"Hey there. I'm Astal,
from Lance Village.";"";"";
592eb;"So, you've come to rescue
him, then, I suppose?";"";"";
59325;"What's that you say? Dr.
Flair's been involved in
a cave-in?! How awful!";"";"";
59379;"But I can't open this door without the
elder's express... Oh, you have permis-
sion? Well, then! In you go!";"";"";
593ef;"It's a shame you didn't come by
earlier, as he was actually here
for a visit until just recently.";"";"";
5945b;"As long as he didn't get side-tracked
somewhere, though, he should be home by
now. So it should only take a moment!";"";"";
594d9;"I'm sorry to sound so bureaucratic,
but we created this law for a reason.
The mine is a real death-trap!";"";"";
5954d;"You'll need the elder's permission
to enter the mine, I'm afraid. You'd
best go and speak with him.";"";"";
595bb;"Hey, you look confused.
Is something the matter?";"";"";
595f7;"You're Adol, right? It's good
to see you're feeling better!";"";"";

rather worried about him!";"";"";
59983;"He went there to gather herbs
for medicine, but he's been
gone an awfully long time...";"";"";
599e5;"Leonor's the one who looked after
you, no? Makes sense, with Dr. Flair
down in the mine.";"";"";
59a49;"I can't let you in
without permission
from the elder, though.";"";"";
59a91;"The abandoned mine is
just through here.";"";"";
59ac5;"Don't know why he'd ever expect
strange young girls to wander
through a place like this, though...";"";"";
59b33;"I told him I hadn't seen any,
and he looked positively dejected!
Slunk away after that, he did.";"";"";
59b9d;"He asked if a pair of young girls
had passed through here.";"";"";
59be3;"He was just here, actually. Swung
by for a visit, and asked me the
most peculiar question...";"";"";

can FEEL it! ...Wait a second...
You're one of them! Gimme that fruit!";"";"";
5b0c9;"But I lost sight of
'em at that statue
of those humans.";"";"";

delicious fruits from those
cocky little yellow guys...";"";"";

always want to sleep, especially
after dinner.";"";"";
5b1b7;"...Wait, you're one of them!
Boy, is MY face red...";"";"";
5b1f1;"I don't care HOW 'sacred' they are,
I just can't stand the sight of 'em!";"";"";
5b241;"They said they lived here
before us, an' were treatin'
us like we weren't wanted!";"";"";
5b299;"We just chased those obnoxiously cute
little creatures to that place with
the statue...but then we lost 'em.";"";"";
5b30d;"We can make a real feast
of his meat. It could be
a pit barbeque!";"";"";
5b355;"Never you mind about some
kidnapped kid. Just find that
Adol guy, and take him out!";"";"";
5b3af;"Not that I'm any different,
really. But I'm more talking
about OTHER people!";"";"";
5b403;"And the higher-ups?
All they ever think
about are themselves!";"";"";
5b447;"Being a demon is pretty rough. The
chain of command is brutal, and you

about this, okay? He would NOT
be happy with me.";"";"";

strength is
fading...";"";"";
5b6c7;"Whoever it is SUCKS.
I mean, we're supposed
to share its power!";"";"";
5b70d;"Someone's hoarding the Black
Pearl. I just know it!";"";"";

Pearl, we're powerless against
that brute, Adol...";"";"";
5b79d;"Fine mess we've gotten
ourselves into, no?";"";"";
5b7cf;"That human kid somehow
got away.";"";"";
5b7f7;"Would kinda defeat the
point of taking him
hostage, you know?";"";"";

human kid in the prison's
gonna starve to death.";"";"";
5b88d;"I'll just say right now,
it was NOT my fault!";"";"";
5b8c1;"Grrrr... That damned
brat got away!";"";"";
5b8eb;"Wonder if he's dead yet...";"";"";
5b90d;"That human kid's been
shut up in that prison
for two days now.";"";"";
5b953;"He's a pretty good
year, after all!";"";"";
5b97d;"Do you think Adol
would taste good?
I bet he would!";"";"";
5b9b7;"The poison gas passage is up
ahead. If you ain't got a leaf,
you'll never make it through!";"";"";
5ba19;"I hear that Adol's head looks like
fire. I wonder if that means he's
spicy, like curry...";"";"";
5ba79;"Out of my way!";"";"";
5ba8f;"I'll take just a single leaf,
even. Gimme, gimme, gimme!";"";"";
5bacf;"I can smell something.
You got one of those
tasty fruits?";"";"";
5bb0f;"I'll take just a single leaf,
even. Gimme, gimme, gimme!";"";"";
5bb4f;"You're one of 'em,
so you must have
some good fruit.";"";"";
5bb8b;"What's wrong? Human
got yer tongue?";"";"";
5bbb5;"You too good to introduce
yourself, 'sacred' beast?";"";"";
5bbef;"Those red hairs of yours...
You're not wearing a piece,
are you?";"";"";
5bc37;"I hear Adol has really
bright, red hair.";"";"";
5bc67;"Celcetan bridge is falling down, falling
down, falling down... Celcetan bridge is
falling down, 'cause Gadis cut it! ♪";"";"";
5bce5;"In fact, none
of us have!";"";"";
5bd05;"He said to look for Adol,
but I ain't seen no humans
'round here at all.";"";"";
5bd55;"Grrrr... We ain't got
no powers without the
Black Pearl...";"";"";
5bd97;"Grrrr... Keith never was any good at
obeying orders. Nothin' but a trouble-
maker, that one!";"";"";
5bdfb;"The Black Pearl was stolen! That's
why we aren't as strong as before...
We'll definitely be executed for this!";"";"";
5be71;"We're in serious trouble. When Lord
Dalles finds out about this, I can't
even imagine what he'll do to us...";"";"";
5bee5;"Serves 'em right
for crossing us!";"";"";
5bf0d;"Keith and that human
kid are gonna starve
in that rock prison.";"";"";
5bf53;"Rawwwrrg... We're done for,
now that the Black Pearl's
been stolen...";"";"";
5bf9f;"We've annexed the bridge from the Colony
of Lava. Now Adol's stuck-- he'll never
make it to the Shrine of Solomon!";"";"";
5c019;"A #c2#Black Pearl#c# is embedded
in the statue's forehead.";"";"";
5c05b;"No";"";"";
5c065;"Yes";"";"";
5c06f;"Take it?";"";"";
5c07d;"I'm such a fretter;
I just can't decide!";"";"";
5c0ad;"Which would be better:
boiled or fried?";"";"";
5c0db;"You think Adol would taste
yummy? I'll be gladol when
he's in my tummy!";"";"";
5c129;"But giving orders is the only thing he
enjoys. So I like to procrastinate, just
to see him get angry.";"";"";
5c195;"He said to go
look for Adol.";"";"";
5c1b9;"...Hand it over, punk!";"";"";
5c1d7;"Hey, you. You got one of
those fruits, don'tcha?";"";"";
5c20f;"#c2#The air is thick with poison
gas. It's much too dangerous
to go any farther!";"";"";
5c267;"Damn that Adol. Oh, but
wait'll he gets a load
of ME...";"";"";
5c2a5;"So...a Roo, huh? How's that working out
for you? ...Also, you got any fruit? I
hear Roos eat some great stuff!";"";"";
5c31b;"Well, we're dead. The captives have been
freed, and Adol managed to get past our
little blockade. Failure, all around!";"";"";
5c399;"Can't believe they'd do something
so reckless. If he dies, then he's
not useful to us anymore, you know?";"";"";
5c409;"I heard the bridge guard's son
was taken through the poison
gas area.";"";"";
5c455;"Make sure he hasn't betrayed us.
Ruba's his name, and if he's plotting
something, his son gets it!";"";"";
5c4bf;"Will you go check on that
bridge guard at the Colony
of Lava for me?";"";"";
5c50b;"Hey you... Yeah, you!
Cutesy McRedhair!
Got a job for you.";"";"";
5c54d;"...That fruit of yours! You've got some,
right? I'll trade you some adventurer's
shank for just a little piece of it!";"";"";
5c5c9;"Psst. Hey, Roo. How much for
a little...you know...";"";"";
5c603;"Gah... When it's this hot, I just feel
like going on a total rampage. Just...
goring anything that moves. You know?";"";"";
5c67d;"It's too damned hot here, but then
if we go to the Ice Ridge, it's too
cold! How does that even work?!";"";"";
5c6eb;"...But I kinda like it!";"";"";
5c709;"I think I'm melting...";"";"";
5c727;"Specifically, the Monster Worker's
Alliance for Halflings, Ancients,
Halberdiers and Armorshells: MWAHAHA.";"";"";
5c799;"But I'm not allowed to take a break! Not
a one! I knew I should've joined the
union. The Monster Worker's Alliance...";"";"";
5c815;"I haven't been feeling
too well lately...";"";"";
5c845;"I could go for mouthing a
big hunk of that Ice Ridge
right about now...";"";"";
5c893;"Ugh, it's soooo hot... All I want
right now is a nice, frosty glass
of humanade!";"";"";
5c8eb;"I'm in a hurry.
Please leave me be.";"";"";
5c915;"True story!";"";"";
5c927;"Apparently that coward,
Adol, is so afraid of me
that he ran away.";"";"";
5c971;"How ironic!";"";"";
5c983;"I heard Adol killed the very demon
who was summoned to kill him.";"";"";
5c9cb;"But a huge demon's been summoned to take
him out, as a last resort contingency
plan. So he's toast, if he does!";"";"";
5ca41;"If the bridge guard turns
traitor on us, Adol will no
doubt be coming this way.";"";"";
5ca97;"So...how about that scorching heat?
Sure is unpleasant, isn't it?";"";"";
5cadf;"I'm sweating so much, I
think I might dry up!";"";"";
5cb13;"Halt! Who goes there?!";"";"";
5cb31;"I'm really sensitive to heat.
Not what you'd expect, is it?";"";"";
5cb73;"...Ominous!";"";"";
5cb85;"That red-haired Adol's been going around
killing us all. He even got Gelaldy, who
was hired specifically to stop him!";"";"";
5cc01;"I will now tell you my terrible
secret. Prepare to receive this
bad medicine!";"";"";
5cc55;"Unless Adol can beat him,
there's no way through.";"";"";
5cc8d;"Even if the bridge guard betrays
us, we still have an ace in the
hole up ahead.";"";"";
5cce3;"Just goes to show you that good
looks don't equal power, y'know?";"";"";
5cd2b;"Looks like Adol was too much
for Gelaldy, after all.";"";"";
5cd67;"...And I'm not talking about
bloodsprout syndrome!";"";"";
5cda1;"We've got a new demon in
place up ahead, to rid us
of our red-haired plague.";"";"";
5cdf5;"Yeah... Adol actually beat
him. I can't believe it!";"";"";
5ce2f;"You know that guy up ahead?
The giant cranium?";"";"";
5ce65;"He's just up ahead.
You should go say hi!";"";"";
5ce95;"This huge guy came here not too long
ago, specifically to take down Adol
in case he makes it this far.";"";"";
5cf03;"I swear, the next time Adol
comes here will be his last!";"";"";
5cf43;"He's a cruel swine.
I'll bet he was cursed
at birth.";"";"";
5cf7f;"We're easy pickings for
that red-haired human,
these days.";"";"";
5cfc1;"You just can't trust
humans, you know?";"";"";
5cfef;"I should go check on him.
...Or YOU should, perhaps...
...So that I don't have to!";"";"";
5d049;"I wonder if that Ruba guy's
doing what we asked...";"";"";
5d083;"Worst of all, though, is this 'love'
thing. I don't even know what love is,
but if it's THAT strong, I want some!";"";"";
5d0fb;"Usually, they're simpering cowards...
but whether by courage or fellowship,
they can sometimes be a royal pain!";"";"";
5d171;"The scariest thing about humans
is their persistence.";"";"";
5d1ad;"*sigh* Gotta do what you
gotta do, I guess!";"";"";
5d1df;"It's almost time for my shift.
I have to go check up on that
bridge guard.";"";"";
5d231;"You just can't trust humans, you know?";"";"";
5d25f;"As long as the bridge guard does
what he's told, Adol won't be able
to get anywhere near Solomon Shrine.";"";"";
5d2cf;"Gelaldy was actually beaten
by a lowly human? Oh, my!";"";"";
5d30b;"...You know, this game of cat and mouse
we've been playing with Adol. I'm quite
enjoying it. What did you THINK I meant?";"";"";
5d38b;"I hate the fact that we take hostages.
But if we didn't, this game would be
way too short!";"";"";
5d3ed;"The village is the
other way, mister!";"";"";
5d419;"Mister, I'm kinda worried.
We seem to be getting farther
and farther from the village...";"";"";
5d479;"Mister... Your sense of
direction is terrible!";"";"";
5d4af;"It's a hard-knock life...";"";"";
5d4cf;"Don't tell Lord Dalles
I've been slacking off.
Promise you won't!";"";"";
5d517;"C'mon, let's get going!";"";"";
5d535;"Thanks!";"";"";
5d543;"That's cold, mister!";"";"";
5d55f;"So, you wanna escort me back to the
village? I mean, I'm a defenseless
little kid, so it'd be mean to say no!";"";"";
5d5d3;"No";"";"";
5d5dd;"Yes";"";"";
5d5e7;"Escort Tarf back to his home?";"";"";
5d609;"Here, try to pass it to me
through the gap in the wall!";"";"";
5d647;"Huh? You have the
#c2#Black Pearl#c#?";"";"";
5d673;"Just a little more to the
right... Almost got it...";"";"";
5d6ad;"Okay, hold it! Right
there! Awesome, I can
feel it!";"";"";
5d6e7;"All right, I've got it!
Thanks, mister!";"";"";
5d715;"My cellmate here says you
should stand back! I think
he's gonna do something!";"";"";
5d769;"Hey! You out there!";"";"";
5d783;"(Wait, what do you mean,
'Tell him to get back'?!)";"";"";
5d7bd;"You're leaving?";"";"";
5d7d3;"...Huh? Keith, where
are you going?";"";"";
5d7fd;"All right! We're out!
We're freeeeee!";"";"";
5d829;"Keith!";"";"";
5d837;"He's gone...";"";"";
5d84b;"Never seen anything like it before!";"";"";
5d875;"He was also really nice. A kind, well-
behaved, intelligent demon.";"";"";
5d8bf;"From what I could tell, he'd been in
here a lot longer than me.";"";"";
5d905;"Even though he's not human, he can speak
our language. And I really wasn't scared
to be around him. He was fun to talk to!";"";"";
5d987;"Keith is a demon who was locked in here
with me.";"";"";
5d9bf;"I was finally starting to get really
hungry, though, so I'm glad you came
when you did!";"";"";
5da1d;"With Keith in here, I almost didn't
mind getting kidnapped-- even though
it's been almost two full days.";"";"";
5da8d;"Anyway, thanks for your help, mister!";"";"";
5dab9;"Why would something like that happen?
Just looks like a rock to me!";"";"";
5db03;"But when I handed him the #c2#Black Pearl#c#,
he suddenly turned...vicious. Like a
normal demon. Then he broke the wall.";"";"";
5db83;"The demon who shut me in here was
telling the others to look for a
red-haired swordsman named Adol.";"";"";
5dbed;"...Oh, hey, are you Adol, by any chance?";"";"";
5dc1d;"But, you came to rescue me, so
I guess all is forgiven!";"";"";
5dc5b;"Y'know, I was kinda wondering if
you're the reason I got locked up
in there...";"";"";
5dcb1;"#c2#...But he realized no one would
be able to understand his words
in his current form.";"";"";
5dd11;"#c2#Adol shouted through the gap in
the rock wall that he had the
Black Pearl...";"";"";
5dd69;"So if you can look around
for it, we'd both really
appreciate it!";"";"";
5ddb1;"If you can find it, Keith says
he can use his strength to get
us outta here!";"";"";
5de05;"Keith was just telling me
that he wants you to bring
him the #c2#Black Pearl#c#.";"";"";
5de5d;"#c2#...But he realized no one would
be able to understand his words
in his current form.";"";"";
5debd;"#c2#Adol heard faint sounds of breathing
through the crack in the wall, and
tried calling out to their source.";"";"";
5df33;"#c2#Adol heard faint sounds of breathing
through the crack in the wall, and
tried calling out to their source.";"";"";
5dfa9;"This stone wall's really solid, so
unless you're a big mass of muscles,
I don't think you can knock it down!";"";"";
5e01d;"I'm Tarf! Are you here
to rescue me?";"";"";
5e049;"Heeeey...!";"";"";
5e05b;"...Is...somebody there?";"";"";
5e079;"(Huh?)";"";"";
5e087;"#c2#It sounded as if Tarf was
speaking with someone on
the other side of the wall.";"";"";
5e0e1;"So see if you can
find it, okay?";"";"";
5e109;"If you can get ahold of it and bring
it here, Keith says he can break the
wall and set us free!";"";"";
5e16f;"He says he wants you to find him
something called the '#c2#Black Pearl#c#.'";"";"";
5e1c1;"Keith asked me to
tell you something.";"";"";
5e1ed;"Hey! You still there?";"";"";
5e209;"(So you need what, exactly? Those are
some pretty specific tastes... Ohhhh,
PEARL! Okay. I thought you said 'girl'!)";"";"";
5e285;"#c2#Adol peered into the crack in the
wall, but it was too dark to see
anything on the other side.";"";"";
5e2ef;"#c2#There's some writing
carved into the rock.";"";"";
5e325;"I don't know how, though. It
was so dark, we could barely
see anything!";"";"";
5e373;"Keith did that.";"";"";
5e389;"Don't you know I'm unscarable?
Sheesh! You're not very good
at playing pranks, are you?";"";"";
5e3e7;"You're Mister Adol! I can tell
by the hair! You think you can
scare me or something?!";"";"";
5e443;"Ohhh, you almost had me
there for a minute!";"";"";
5e475;"But you look kinda weak. Demons
should be more ferocious-looking--
like Keith!";"";"";
5e4cb;"You know, that's actually
pretty cool.";"";"";
5e4f9;"Heheh... Good luck, Mister
Adol! I'm counting on you!";"";"";
5e535;"If we go through the hole Keith
made, we should come out near the
Colony of Lava, where I live.";"";"";
5e59b;"Maybe YOU can breathe poison without
dying a horrible death, but I sure
can't! So let's NOT go that way!";"";"";
5e60b;"That passageway is
full of poison gas.";"";"";
5e639;"Guess you missed out. You
only got to see him from
the back.";"";"";
5e67d;"MUST BE SURE!
BE SURE, BE SURE!";"";"";
5e6a3;"HE NOT IN WATER
CONTROL ROOM?";"";"";
5e6c7;"YOU FIND RUNAWAYS?
YOU TELL ME RIGHT
AWAY IF DO!";"";"";
5e6ff;"HE HERE...
MUST BE HERE!
MUST, MUST!";"";"";
5e72b;"YOU FIND RUNAWAYS?
YOU TELL ME RIGHT
AWAY IF DO!";"";"";
5e763;"WHERE RUNAWAYS GO?";"";"";
5e77d;"WHERE HE GO?
WHERE GO, WHERE GO?!";"";"";
5e7a5;"MUST BE SURE!
BE SURE, BE SURE!";"";"";
5e7cb;"HE NOT IN WATER
CONTROL ROOM?";"";"";
5e7ef;"WHERE RUNAWAYS GO?";"";"";
5e809;"WHERE HE GO?
WHERE GO, WHERE GO?!";"";"";
5e831;"HE HERE...
MUST BE HERE!
MUST, MUST!";"";"";
5e85d;"YOU IN WAY OF WORK.
IN WAY, IN WAY!";"";"";
5e887;"YOU IN WAY.";"";"";
5e899;"YOU IN WAY OF WORK.
IN WAY, IN WAY!";"";"";
5e8c3;"YOU IN WAY.";"";"";
5e8d5;"Ack! A demon! We're doooooooooooomed!
...Oh, wait. False alarm. It's Keith.";"";"";
5e927;"Adol, this is the man who
helped us in the bell tower.";"";"";
5e965;"...";"";"";
5e96f;"Take care. I'm
going on ahead.";"";"";
5e995;"It's a Wing!";"";"";
5e9a9;"We can use that to get
everyone safely back to
the village!";"";"";
5e9eb;"All right! We can go home!";"";"";
5ea0d;"You're a real lifesaver. Don't worry,
we won't get in your way. We're going
to head back to the village.";"";"";
5ea7d;"Thank you so much, Adol.
If only Lilia were here,
things would be perfect!";"";"";
5eacf;"#c2#Adol swore that he
would find Lilia.";"";"";
5eaff;"We'd never entered it before... but it
seemed like we were being guided there,
somehow. So we left ourselves to fate.";"";"";
5eb7b;"I think the area where I got it is
called...I want to say, the Sacred
District of Toal? Something like that.";"";"";
5ebef;"I found it in the old, abandoned
Rasteenie Mine. No clue what it
was doing down there.";"";"";
5ec4d;"Understood. I'll leave her up to
you, then. ...Oh, that reminds me!
I picked this up before I was captured.";"";"";
5ecbf;"You may need it in your battles,
Adol. You should take it with you.";"";"";
5ed09;"Anyway, I'll see you later, Adol.
You can do this... I know you can!
I believe in you!";"";"";
5ed67;"Oh no! It's a demon! Have
we been found?!";"";"";
5ed97;"But that aside...we're saved!
You did it! You saved us all!
I knew you'd pull through!";"";"";
5edf5;"I work with stone for a living, and let
me tell you, getting turned into it is a
much less rewarding experience!";"";"";
5ee6d;"Hoooooooooaaaaaaaaaah!
Air! Delicious air!";"";"";
5ee9f;"Air! In my lungs! ...Words...fail...
Should've...sent a poet...";"";"";
5eee5;"*hooooooooohhhh*
*haaaaaahhhhhh*";"";"";
5ef0d;"Now, don't be too surprised,
but Lilia's here, too.";"";"";
5ef47;"I was captured by demons in
Rasteenie, and...well...you
know the rest, I suppose!";"";"";
5ef9f;"It's me, Bohtz, the
miner from Lance!";"";"";
5efcb;"Well, now, this is a surprise.
If it isn't Adol Christin!";"";"";
5f00b;"Pretty smooth, lover boy. You work fast!
You should go see her, and get what's
comin' to you!";"";"";
5f06f;"She escaped here with the rest of us,
and she simply won't shut up about you!
I do believe she's smitten...";"";"";
5f0e1;"Well, well... It's a Roo!
Now I KNOW we'll be okay!";"";"";
5f11b;"From what I overheard, the demons are
coming from the Ys Core, which is even
deeper underground than the canal.";"";"";
5f191;"I was keeping my ears open while
we were being taken away.";"";"";
5f1d3;"I doubt you'd remember me.
I'm Noit, from the Colony
of Lava.";"";"";
5f217;"Hey, aren't you Adol?";"";"";
5f233;"But if you touch a Goddess statue with
something once owned by the Goddesses,
you'll go where you need to be.";"";"";
5f2a7;"Seems that the passage leading to
the Goddesses' Palace has been sealed
off in some peculiar manner.";"";"";
5f313;"A demon named Keith
told me something
before we came here.";"";"";
5f355;"Gyaaargh!";"";"";
5f365;"Could it be...?
Is Ys...returning
to the surface...?";"";"";
5f3a1;"When I was being held in the bell tower,
I looked outside and realized I could
see the world below.";"";"";
5f40b;"We got away from the demons easily
enough, but Maria was captured. If
we don't hurry, she'll be sacrificed!";"";"";
5f47d;"Goddesses! Saaaaaave me!";"";"";
5f49d;"Aiieeeeeee!";"";"";
5f4af;"May the Goddesses keep her
safe, and deliver her back
into our care...";"";"";
5f4fd;"This place is teeming with
demons... It's not safe for
her to be here alone!";"";"";
5f551;"When I came to, Lilia was
gone. I wonder where she
could have gotten off to?";"";"";
5f5a5;"Silly, huh? Probably
just my imagination!";"";"";
5f5d5;"The weirdest part, though...is that a
friend of mine died a while ago, and
that demon...reminded me of him...";"";"";
5f649;"Strangest thing I've ever seen...
A green demon came and rescued us!";"";"";
5f695;"Wasn't anyone
keeping watch?!";"";"";
5f6b9;"Aieee! We've been breached!
There's a demon in here!";"";"";
5f6f5;"I would wager that he's
been changed back as well.";"";"";
5f72f;"Well, he said someone else in the
Shrine was also turned to stone,
just as we were.";"";"";
5f789;"That friendly demon named
Keith told me...";"";"";
5f7bb;"Thank you for saving us.";"";"";
5f7db;"Everyone who escaped from the demons is
hiding here. We can't stay here forever,
but we'd never last out there...";"";"";
5f853;"#c2#It was as if time had stopped
for everyone except Adol.#c#";"";"";
5f899;"#c2#Lilia stood in place, still
and silent as a statue.#c#";"";"";
5f8db;"Oh, it's a Roo! What's wrong,
little fellow? Are you lost?";"";"";
5f91d;"Can it be? Is it really you?!";"";"";
5f941;"Adol!";"";"";
5f94d;"It's like a dream... I-I never thought
I'd see you again...";"";"";
5f98f;"We all fled here after a demon named
Keith saved us from the bell tower
where we were being held.";"";"";
5f9f7;"I was just out walking, not far from
the village, when some demons on the
hunt came out of nowhere...";"";"";
5fa63;"I'm quite certain you'll be able to make
good use of it, Adol.";"";"";
5faa9;"While we were escaping, he gave me this
key and said to pass it on to you. It's
the master key for all the Shrine doors.";"";"";
5fb29;"#c0#I must congratulate you on all your
accomplishments, lapdog. I'm sure the
Goddesses have a treat for you!";"";"";
5fb9d;"#c2#An ominous voice suddenly echoed
from all around Adol.#c#";"";"";
5fbe1;"#c0#My precious little runaways... Since you
so deeply fear sacrifice, I'll spare you
that fate...in favor of another!";"";"";
5fc5f;"#c0#You cope well with your own suffering,
swordsman, but how might you fare in
dealing with the torment of others?";"";"";
5fcd9;"#c0#These people have learned all too much
about this forsaken land...so of course,
I simply CANNOT permit them to live!";"";"";
5fd59;"#c0#You are a most helpful soul, though.
You've led me right to the hideout
of these obnoxious runaways...";"";"";
5fdcb;"#c2#All at once, all sound was drained from
the immediate vicinity. For a moment,
Adol feared he had been stricken deaf.#c#";"";"";
5fe4d;"#c0#Behold...and despair at how powerless
you truly are!";"";"";
5fe8d;"#c0#As a token of my thanks to you for
finding these wretches, I've spared
you from the spell's effects.";"";"";
5fefd;"#c2#As Adol pulled the lever, he heard a low
metallic grating, followed by the sound
of rushing water.";"";"";
5ff6b;"There's a lever here.";"";"";
5ff87;"No";"";"";
5ff91;"Yes";"";"";
5ff9b;"Pull the lever?";"";"";
5ffaf;"It won't budge...";"";"";
5ffc7;"Oh!";"";"";
5ffd5;"They must've tracked us down. Everyone,
set your weight against the door! Keep
that thing out, no matter what!";"";"";
6004b;"Aaaagh! Demon! DEEEEMOOOON!";"";"";
6006d;"Keep the door held shut! Do
NOT let that thing in here,
under any circumstances!";"";"";
600c5;"Aaaagh! The demons are back!";"";"";
600e9;"Keep the door held shut! Do
NOT let that thing in here,
under any circumstances!";"";"";
60141;"The demon's still there!
I can hear him shuffling
around!";"";"";
60181;"#c2#Adol tried to explain what had happened,
but in his Roo form, he was unable to
speak in any recognizable language.";"";"";
601ff;"Well, now, this is a surprise.
If it isn't Adol Christin!";"";"";
6023f;"Now, don't be too surprised,
but Lilia's here, too.";"";"";
60279;"I was captured by demons in
Rasteenie, and...well...you
know the rest, I suppose!";"";"";
602d1;"It's me, Bohtz, the
miner from Lance!";"";"";
602fd;"Pretty smooth, lover boy. You work fast!
You should go see her, and get what's
comin' to you!";"";"";
60361;"She escaped here with the rest of us,
and she simply won't shut up about you!
I do believe she's smitten...";"";"";
603d3;"Ahhh, I just love dark and gloomy
places like this!";"";"";
6040d;"Which way is the exit?
I long to see the sun...";"";"";
60443;"This was a stupid place to
hide something so important,
don't you think?";"";"";
60493;"The pendant's been taken.";"";"";
604b3;"Something important's been hidden
somewhere around here, but I can't
remember where! What should I do?";"";"";
60521;"Hrmph. There's something vaguely...
human...about you. I don't like it!";"";"";
6056f;"There's a statue somewhere around here
that's apparently a human Lord Dalles
turned to stone. It's quite exquisite!";"";"";
605e9;"I don't like it down here.
I can't spread my wings and
fly in a place like this!";"";"";
60641;"You reek of humans.
It sickens me.
Go away.";"";"";
60673;"Some other demons told me there's a
statue down here carrying a sharp white
sword. Wish I had a sword like that!";"";"";
606eb;"How could he ever figure out that
the pendant is hidden down here?
Heh heh, it's the perfect place!";"";"";
60755;"Adol will never figure out that the
pendant is hidden down here. Never!";"";"";
607a3;"The pendant was stolen...";"";"";
607c3;"Remember, the pendant's down here.
Keep alert!";"";"";
607f9;"Truth be told, my feathers
are just for show. They don't
benefit me in any way!";"";"";
6084f;"The pendant's gone missing.
I should have just taken the
damned thing myself!";"";"";
608a3;"I want that pendant...";"";"";
608c1;"#c2#There's a statue of a swordsman here.
It seems strangely out of place.";"";"";
60913;"...What's the use? I could take out all
my anger on you, but it still wouldn't
bring Maria back...";"";"";
6097d;"...A demon...?";"";"";
60993;"You're a peculiar demon,
aren't you...";"";"";
609c1;"Please, use that sword, and fight on
my behalf. I...I've lost all the reason
I ever had to fight the demons.";"";"";
60a35;"I...I'll be fine on my own.
Once I've calmed down a bit,
I'll return to the village.";"";"";
60a91;"I came here to rescue my fiancee,
Maria...but a man in a black cloak
cast a spell and turned me to stone.";"";"";
60b05;"Much obliged. My name is Sada,
of Ramia Village.";"";"";
60b41;"I see... You reversed the
petrification?";"";"";
60b75;"Who are you...?";"";"";
60b8f;"#c2#Adol hesitantly told Sada that
Maria had been sacrificed.";"";"";
60bd3;"...#w20#Maria...";"";"";
60bef;"I-I...
If only I'd
come sooner...";"";"";
60c1b;"...";"";"";
60c29;"No...!";"";"";
60c3b;"As I've lost my will to fight, I
believe it would be put to better
use in your hands. Please, take it.";"";"";
60cad;"This sword has been passed down
through my family for generations.";"";"";
60cfb;"I...have no further need of a sword.
The one I sought to protect...#w16#is beyond
protection now.";"";"";
60d67;"...Thank you...for fighting to rescue
her. Even if you weren't successful, I
respect the effort alone.";"";"";
60dd9;"...";"";"";
60de7;"If you tell my father that I'm
alive and well, I believe he'll
let you use it.";"";"";
60e41;"Oh, yes... In my home, there's also a
suit of armor made of the same metal.";"";"";
60e97;"It's no ordinary sword. It possesses
an incredible strength. Really, it's
the only thing that got me this far.";"";"";
60f11;"#c2#There's a statue of a swordsman here.
It seems strangely out of place.";"";"";
60f63;"You goof off, too?";"";"";
60f7d;"Round and round and round...
We search and search, but why?
We never find him!";"";"";
60fd3;"You no loaf! Get searching!";"";"";
60ff5;"Keith definitely somewhere
around here.";"";"";
61023;"You no loaf! Get searching!";"";"";
61045;"Keith definitely somewhere
around here.";"";"";
61073;"Very strange... Very strange...";"";"";
61099;"I want fall in love too.";"";"";
610b9;"You goof off, too?";"";"";
610d3;"It stupid to keep hunting for him.";"";"";
610fd;"You know what Keith look like?";"";"";
61123;"You know what color Keith is?";"";"";
61147;"...No call out for him,
no way he ever show
himself, right?";"";"";
61189;"Keeeeeeeiiiith!";"";"";
6119f;"...He probably too smart
to come when called. Why
he so smart?!";"";"";
611e5;"Keeeeeeeiiiith!";"";"";
611fb;"I'm not your enemy. It's okay
to talk to me in human form.";"";"";
6123d;"Here, I've got the key. Take it.
Consider it my thanks for your help
in the lava prison.";"";"";
6129d;"Go to the Water Control Room. Once
you're there, close the water gates
to dam the canal. That's the first step.";"";"";
61313;"From what I can tell, though, the only
way left to get there is to slip in
through this canal.";"";"";
61379;"Then what you need to do is go to the
Goddesses' Palace.";"";"";
613b9;"You need to contact the Goddesses,
right?";"";"";
613e9;"I...I lost control of my emotions. So I
ran away from the guards and hid here.";"";"";
6143f;"My name is Keith.";"";"";
61457;"You're the one who helped me when I was
locked in the Burnedbless lava prison.";"";"";
614ad;"I'm going to stay here for a while,
and try to calm myself.";"";"";
614ef;"#c1#Hadat#c#
#c0#But be careful! Get here when you can.
Don't rush! You'll let your guard down!";"";"";
61555;"#c1#Hadat#c#
#c0#Please come back to the village, so we
can speak of this face-to-face.";"";"";
615b3;"#c1#Hadat#c#
#c0#Adol, there's a boy here to see you...
He says he has urgent news.";"";"";
6160d;"#c2#Adol heard a voice coming from
the Lila Shell.#c#";"";"";
61649;"Demons these days
seem younger than
they used to be...";"";"";
61687;"The final battle is at hand.
You must persevere!";"";"";
616bf;"I was born of the essence of magic.
No parlor tricks granted you by the
Priests will have any effect on me.";"";"";
61731;"I will utter a prayer over your mangled
corpse. The hopes of the Goddesses will
fall into ruin on this spot.";"";"";
617a5;"Adol the Red. At long last, you've come.
I never suspected you to be so strong...
but this is where it ends.";"";"";
61819;"What brings you to take up arms when you
know you have no chance of victory?";"";"";
61871;"...Truly, humans are incomprehensible
vermin.";"";"";
618a9;"And I shall be the one to cut your
strings.";"";"";
618df;"Legendary brave soul? Ha! You're but a
puppet, dancing for the Goddesses'
amusement!";"";"";
6193f;"To think, the Goddesses would choose a
weakling like you...";"";"";
61981;"Do you honestly think you have the skill
to defeat the mighty Dalles?!";"";"";
619cf;"You are powerless.";"";"";
619e9;"Ha ha ha! Break a leg, buddy!
It's showtime!";"";"";
61a1d;"It smells soooo gooooood...";"";"";
61a43;"It feels warm and sinful.";"";"";
61a67;"Adol wished he could latch on to this
feeling, and never let it go...";"";"";
61ab7;"Don't do it";"";"";
61ac9;"Get in";"";"";
61ad7;"It's Lilia's bed.";"";"";
61aed;"Don't do it";"";"";
61aff;"Get in";"";"";
61b0d;"It's Zalem's bed.";"";"";
61b23;"Don't do it";"";"";
61b35;"Get in";"";"";
61b43;"It's Maria's bed.";"";"";
61b59;"No way, man!";"";"";
61b6d;"Get up";"";"";
61b7b;"Get up soon?";"";"";
61b8d;"No way, man!";"";"";
61ba1;"Leave";"";"";
61bad;"Take your leave?";"";"";
61bc3;"There seem to be no mosquitoes
in pursuit-- fortunately!";"";"";
61c03;"Well, what was your
impression of him?";"";"";
61c31;"So you went to see Old Man Regg,
did you?";"";"";
61c61;"Don't let his looks fool you. He's
actually real smart. He even understands
the language of the demons...sort of.";"";"";
61cd9;"Means someone else has been killed...
How long is this going to continue?";"";"";
61d29;"You hear that bell toll?";"";"";
61d49;"(Damned demons... They come around and
act like they own this whole land...)";"";"";
61d9d;"Even though I can see it
with my own eyes, I keep
thinking it's a dream...";"";"";
61def;"After so many years in the sky,
Ys...returning to the ground...
Still hard to wrap my head around...";"";"";
61e5b;"Take a look. You can see the surface
world really clearly from here.";"";"";
61ea7;"Well, what have we here?
You're not from around
here, are you...?";"";"";
61eef;"If you can, please pay him a visit and
tell him stories of your journey. It'll
brighten his spirits, I think.";"";"";
61f63;"Because of all the demons, though, he's
no longer able to research the Solomon
Shrine. It's got him pretty down...";"";"";
61fdd;"There's an old man who lives here named
Regg...a scholar, you might say. Every-
one thinks of him like family.";"";"";
62053;"If you're a friend...and if you can
understand my words...would you ask the
demons to stop sacrificing us? Please?";"";"";
620cd;"Ah, a Roo. Are you friend or foe,
ancient creature?!";"";"";
62109;"And when I look at you, I somehow get
the feeling that everything's going
to be just fine...";"";"";
6216d;"I'm not scared of anything!";"";"";
6218f;"I give you my deepest gratitude,
from the bottom of my heart.";"";"";
621d3;"Thank you for saving everyone.
Thank you so much...";"";"";
6220d;"How long are the sacrificial
ceremonies going to continue?";"";"";
6224f;"When will the Goddesses grant
us mercy, and save us from this
horrible fate...?";"";"";
622a5;"Ever since her daughter, Maria,
was taken away by the demons, she's
shut herself in her house, crying.";"";"";
62313;"Poor Karen...";"";"";
62327;"(I wonder who'll be next?
Will it be me...?)";"";"";
6235b;"What is this world coming to?!";"";"";
62381;"This is simply unbelievable...
It's simply absurd! Ys...returning
to the surface?!";"";"";
623db;"This climate... This atmosphere...
It's unlike anything I've experienced
before...";"";"";
62435;"It seems like the wind has become
gentler...like we're not going to
get as many storms...";"";"";
62495;"The water there is crystal clear.
Take a drink of it, and you'll be
amazed at how refreshed you feel.";"";"";
62501;"There's an ancient well in
old man Regg's basement.";"";"";
6253b;"Are you a traveler? If so, I've
got some good advice for you.";"";"";
6257f;"Eeeek!";"";"";
6258d;"...I-I beg you! Please,
give Maria back to me!";"";"";
625c3;"May your journey continue to
be blessed, Adol Christin.";"";"";
62601;"If you haven't already, please
give the good news to Karen and
Sada, as well.";"";"";
62655;"Adol, thank you so much
for telling me!";"";"";
62683;"Maria's okay? My stars, you have
no idea what a relief that is.
Praises be to the Goddesses!";"";"";
626e7;"And the air is so warm...
It's all so strange...";"";"";
6271f;"We usually see the clouds far below,
but now they're so high above...";"";"";
6276b;"The sacrificial bell just rang...
Oh, Maria...";"";"";
627a1;"There are always guards posted at
the entrance to the Shrine, anyway,
so I'd never even get in!";"";"";
62807;"I wish I could go save her,
but someone like me wouldn't
last two minutes in there!";"";"";
62861;"Three days ago, my friend Maria
was captured by demons, and taken
away for sacrifice.";"";"";
628bd;"I only just got back to the village.
Please, give me a break here!";"";"";
62907;"My daughter and I both will pray
for your victory and safe return.";"";"";
62951;"No matter how grim things may look, I'll
continue doing what I've been doing.
It's all I CAN do, really...";"";"";
629c3;"My daughter and I both will pray
for your victory and safe return.";"";"";
62a0d;"It's entirely because of you that I
was able to see my daughter again.
I can never thank you enough.";"";"";
62a79;"My daughter and I both will pray
for your victory and safe return.";"";"";
62ac3;"It's entirely because of you that I
was able to see my daughter again.
I can never thank you enough.";"";"";
62b2f;"...Adol, right? I'm in your debt.
What you did beneath the Shrine
was a tremendous display of heroism.";"";"";
62b9d;"I believe things will turn out just
fine. Surely, the Goddesses smile
upon us, no?";"";"";
62bf7;"Ys, back on the world's surface...
Is this the will of the Goddesses?";"";"";
62c43;"May the blessings of the Goddesses
be with you in your travels.";"";"";
62c89;"Now we can put all that unpleasantness
behind us, once and for all.";"";"";
62cd3;"It's a relief to know that
Maria and Lilia are well.";"";"";
62d0f;"My gratitude to you as well, Adol,
for letting me know.";"";"";
62d4d;"Oh, Goddesses! Praises be unto you!";"";"";
62d77;"Now we can put all that unpleasantness
behind us, once and for all.";"";"";
62dc1;"Oh? Maria and Lilia are safe
as well, you say?";"";"";
62df7;"...Again? Give me a break, already!";"";"";
62e21;"Now, if only Maria and Lilia were
safely home, as well...";"";"";
62e61;"We were very fortunate. No
doubt the Goddesses were
watching over us.";"";"";
62ead;"It is to you and that green demon that
we owe our thanks. Without you both, we
would never have seen Ramia again.";"";"";
62f25;"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Heeeeeeelp!
Sooooooooomeboooooooody!";"";"";
62f61;"Looking over the cliff edge, with the
world below getting closer and closer...
It was genuinely frightening!";"";"";
62fd5;"My heart's still pounding... See how
strange the sky looks? It's because Ys
has passed through the clouds!";"";"";
63047;"Thank you for all that you did.";"";"";
6306d;"I never thought I'd live to
see Ramia Village again.";"";"";
630a9;"You're Adol, are you not? We spoke
in the hideout beneath the Shrine.";"";"";
630f5;"(Might as well just start
digging my grave right now,
at this rate...)";"";"";
63143;"...";"";"";
6314d;"Maria's okay? That's wonderful news!";"";"";
63179;"Whoa, seriously? Maria's...alive?
And unharmed?!";"";"";
631b1;"Ohhh, my my my... It's so great
to hear that Maria is safe. So
absolutely wonderful!";"";"";
6320d;"I can't even imagine the look on his
face when he finds out!";"";"";
63251;"If you haven't told him yet,
then go do it! He's probably
still in the graveyard.";"";"";
632a9;"He's basically wasted his time and
effort...but I can't think of anyone
who'll be happier to hear it!";"";"";
63315;"Sada's been working on a gravesite for
Maria...crying the whole time...";"";"";
63363;"Heh...heheh...";"";"";
63379;"These flowers bear her name. She always
loved them...so as long they bloom here,
I think that means she's happy...";"";"";
633f3;"She's the only one who's left us
earthly remains to bury. I wonder
if she's lonely down there...";"";"";
6345b;"All of these gravesites are empty;
they're essentially just memorials.
Except for Marle's, anyway...";"";"";
634c7;"We've lost so many in the
last six months...";"";"";
634fb;"None of the bodies have ever been
recovered, but we couldn't just
leave it at that, you know?";"";"";
6355f;"These are the graves of all
those who were sacrificed...";"";"";
6359f;"If you try it, I'll use my
super-powerful magic on you!";"";"";
635dd;"I won't let you lay a hand
on my Frau, ja?";"";"";
6360f;"You want me to fight by
your side, too? I'll do it!
I really will!";"";"";
63659;"We've got a whole new world to
explore out there, and I dunno
WHAT could be waiting for me there!";"";"";
636c1;"Mister Adol! You gotta
teach me some magic!";"";"";
636f3;"I'd bet good money that he was
a demon dressed up like a human.";"";"";
63739;"Some suspicious-looking guy
just went through the gate.";"";"";
63777;"You gotta teach me some spells
sometime! Pleeeeeease?";"";"";
637b3;"Mister Adol... Are you
really a magician?!";"";"";
637e5;"Heh. I just heard
some real juicy
gossip from Gorto.";"";"";
63821;"It can get pretty rough around
here, so be careful, okay?";"";"";
63861;"Mister Adol, are you goin' off
on an adventure?";"";"";
63897;"Hey mister, I've never seen you
before. What's your name? Mine's
Faye. Kinda girly, I know!";"";"";
638f9;"#c2#Adol told the little boy his name.";"";"";
63927;"It can get pretty rough around
here, so be careful, okay?";"";"";
63967;"Mister Adol, Mister Adol!
You goin' off on an adventure,
Mister Adol?";"";"";
639b3;"I'll be your friend, Mr. Adol!";"";"";
639d9;"Are you still all by yourself?";"";"";
639ff;"*sniffle* I'm soooo loooonely...";"";"";
63a27;"Are you all by yourself,
like me?";"";"";
63a4f;"If you see them, can you ask them
to protect everyone for me, please?";"";"";
63a9b;"Did you get to meet the
Goddesses, then, mister?";"";"";
63ad3;"You're from the world below, right?
My daddy told me so.";"";"";
63b13;"Daddy says that you're doin'
somethin' for the Goddesses.
That's why I'm thanking you.";"";"";
63b71;"Heh. Thanks, mister.";"";"";
63b8d;"So I'll bet he's gonna show
up any time now!";"";"";
63bc1;"I've been prayin' to the
Goddesses to bring him
back home ever since.";"";"";
63c0d;"Daddy's gone missing...";"";"";

63c45;"I've looked everywhere,
but I can't find him!";"";"";
63c79;"Daddy, where
did you go?";"";"";
63c99;"That red hair...
You must be Adol.";"";"";
63cc3;"I believe you have the strength
to end this. Fight the good fight,
Adol Christin!";"";"";
63d1b;"I'll be here, praying for your
victory and safe return.";"";"";
63d59;"I believe you have the strength
to end this. Fight the good fight,
Adol Christin!";"";"";
63db1;"I'll be here, praying for your
victory and safe return. And
Maria's, as well...";"";"";
63e07;"If you haven't done so already,
you really should go and tell
Maria's mother the good news, too.";"";"";
63e6f;"But I never truly believed I'd actually
be ABLE to come to terms with it. And
now...I don't have to. Thanks to you.";"";"";
63ee9;"In my grief, I thought that digging
her gravesite was the only way I'd
ever come to terms with what happened...";"";"";
63f5f;"Almighty Goddesses... Thank you
so much for your blessings! And
Adol, you too, of course...";"";"";
63fc1;"Wait... Maria is safe?
Truly?!";"";"";
63fe7;"I'm going to rescue Maria, even
if I have to take down every last
demon to do so.";"";"";
6403f;"Open the gate, Gorto.";"";"";
6405b;"You need to calm down, and wait for the
right chance. Jump in without thinking,
and you'll just get yourself killed!";"";"";
640d7;"Sada, look... I understand your
feelings, I really do...but let's
not do anything rash, okay?";"";"";
6413b;"If I do that, Maria's going to DIE!
And I'm sorry, but I just can't let
that happen!";"";"";
64197;"So you want me to just sit around
in the vain hope that a perfect
opportunity comes along?!";"";"";
641f9;"I know all that. I do understand the
gravity of the situation! And I feel
exactly the same way you do.";"";"";
64267;"Maria is my life. There's not going to
BE a perfect opportunity. It's now or
never, and never's not an option!";"";"";
642dd;"Then why are you standing
in my way?!";"";"";
64309;"Sada...";"";"";
64317;"STAND ASIDE, GORTO!";"";"";
64331;"I'm sorry...but I can't
just let Maria die. I hope
you understand.";"";"";
6437b;"Sada... You...";"";"";
64391;"Make sure this gate
stays shut!";"";"";
643b7;"Wait... Adol...? What's with the cutesy
costume? You look like a demon! Stay
like that and you'll get attacked!";"";"";
6442d;"A demon...?!";"";"";
64441;"You really do look
just like a Roo.";"";"";
6446b;"That's some pretty
impressive magic.";"";"";
64497;"How the heck did you
turn yourself into a
Roo?!";"";"";
644cd;"...Wait a second...
Is that you, Adol?!";"";"";
644fb;"Agggh!";"";"";
64509;"Oh... It's just a Roo.
Don't scare people like
that, little fella!";"";"";
64553;"Agggh!";"";"";
64561;"The other villagers and I want to
extend our gratitude to you, though,
nonetheless. Stand firm, adventurer!";"";"";
645d3;"Sada is alive and well,
but Maria...was not so
fortunate...";"";"";
64615;"Glad you found the
Black Pearl!";"";"";
6463b;"Glad you found the
Black Pearl!";"";"";
64661;"The #c2#Black Pearl#c#...?";"";"";
64683;"It's kinda weird... I only took my eyes
off of him for a second, and suddenly,
he was gone!";"";"";
646e5;"The question is, where did he go with
it...?";"";"";
64719;"I'll bet that was it!";"";"";
64735;"I saw a man in a #c2#black cloak#c# bend down
and pick up a pebble or something a
little while ago...";"";"";
647a1;"If he was a demon, maybe he could
teleport or something. So it might
be somewhere secure in the Shrine...";"";"";
64811;"It's kinda weird... I only took
my eyes off of him for a second,
and suddenly, he was gone!";"";"";
64873;"I'll bet it was the Black Pearl!
The question is, where did he go
with it?";"";"";
648c5;"I saw a man in a #c2#black cloak#c# bend
down and pick up a pebble or
something a little while ago...";"";"";
64931;"Could it be that Ys is returning
to the surface...? That couldn't
possibly be it...right?";"";"";
64991;"The weather has been getting much
warmer, lately...far, FAR warmer
than ever before.";"";"";
649ed;"You know, I've been thinking...";"";"";
64a13;"Must be pretty brave, though,
to have come all the way from
the Lava Colony by himself.";"";"";
64a71;"Hey, Adol. You seen that kid
around here? He's a bit of a
troublemaker...";"";"";
64ac1;"Those two girls in my dream told me to
help you, but even if they hadn't, I get
this weird feeling I'd do it anyway...";"";"";
64b3f;"If you have any problems,
Adol, you be sure to let me
know about 'em!";"";"";
64b8b;"All right, gimme a sec.
I'll open the gate.";"";"";
64bbd;"You can use that to bug Hadat from
anywhere in Ys, right? Pretty handy
little artifact to have on hand!";"";"";
64c2b;"Oh-ho, so Hadat gave you
the #c2#Lila Shell#c#, did he?";"";"";
64c69;"That's as far as you go. Gotta
wait for the full version before
I'll let you go any farther.";"";"";
64ccd;"Well, there you are, then.
Take care, Adol!";"";"";
64cff;"He lives in the wooden house
all the way at the bottom of
the stairs here.";"";"";
64d51;"First and foremost, you should
go and see #c2#Hadat#c#.";"";"";
64d8f;"So you're...? Hmmm...
Interesting...";"";"";
64dbb;"I hate to be a bother, but I really need
to get your take on something. Can you
spare a moment?";"";"";
64e21;"My name is Gorto.";"";"";
64e39;"...And here you are!";"";"";
64e55;"They said they wanted me to offer him my
help.";"";"";
64e8b;"In it, there were these two girls who
told me a red-haired swordsman would
soon be arriving in the village.";"";"";
64efd;"Three days ago, I had a really strange
dream.";"";"";
64f31;"#c2#Adol told the guard about the scroll
that had led him to Solomon Shrine.";"";"";
64f85;"Unless you can turn yourself into a
monster or something, you've run up
against a brick wall.";"";"";
64fe9;"And as you'd expect, they don't take
kindly to humans passing through.";"";"";
65037;"...there's still another gate beyond,
guarded by demons. You'll need to get
past them to get into Solomon Shrine.";"";"";
650af;"I see. But even if I let you through
this gate...";"";"";
650e7;"#c2#Gorto's expression turned solemn.";"";"";
65113;"There's a friend of mine... Sada. He
went in recently. I tried to stop him,
but I couldn't.";"";"";
65175;"You may be strong, but I don't think
you'll be able to infiltrate the Shrine
without a bit of forethought.";"";"";
651e7;"I guess the best thing I could do to
help you would be to open this gate...
but I'm a little afraid to...";"";"";
65257;"But Solomon Shrine is many times larger
than this village, and the layout is
about as labyrinthine as it gets.";"";"";
652cd;"Knowing him as well as I do,
I expect he'll give the demons
a run for their money...";"";"";
65329;"He's got a good head on his shoulders.
He'll be able to help you cook up a
plan of attack, for sure!";"";"";
65395;"Hmmm... Before you head into the
Shrine, you should go ask #c2#Hadat#c#
for some assistance.";"";"";
653f9;"...";"";"";
65403;"Oh, hey, it's a Roo. Roos aren't
violent creatures, so I guess...
welcome to our humble village?";"";"";
6546b;"(It won't attack. I know it won't!
I just have to keep my mouth shut,
and wait for it to go away...)";"";"";
654d7;"Oh, hey, it's a Roo. Roos aren't
violent creatures, so I guess...
welcome to our humble village?";"";"";
6553f;"Huh...? Hey, don't
scare me like that!";"";"";
6556d;"Ack! Where did YOU come from?!";"";"";
65593;"Watch your back. I'll
be rooting for you from
out here!";"";"";

THAT if you plan on intimidating anyone!";"";"";

brush off an innocent man?";"";"";

coming back, though. You

responsible for THAT, can you?";"";"";

Aren't you on a desperate quest to
save us all?";"";"";

I'm so glad...so very, very glad!";"";"";
66f47;"...Well, if all you do is push on,
I suppose you'll just wear yourself
out. So...stay as long as you'd like.";"";"";
66fbb;"I tried to stop him, being his father
and all...but he's a pretty obstinate
one. Kinda reminds me of someone else...";"";"";
67037;"That man in the black cloak showed up
earlier, and Tarf went after him, to
find out what he's after.";"";"";
670a3;"Hey, Adol. Have you seen Tarf?";"";"";
670c9;"He kept bugging me to give it
a shot, so I finally agreed.
Never seen him so excited!";"";"";
67125;"Tarf's on bridge duty!";"";"";
67143;"Hey, Adol. Did you see?
My little boy is growing up!";"";"";
6717f;"Tarf is inside. Feel free to have
him prepare a bed for you. You can
stay with us as long as you'd like!";"";"";
671ef;"What's wrong, Adol? You
look like you seriously
need a vacation!";"";"";
67237;"I'm so sorry for snubbing
you, Adol. You're a true
hero!";"";"";
67277;"...What?! You lost
sight of him?!";"";"";
6729f;"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times
thank you! So...where is he? Did he
go back home already?";"";"";
67307;"For true?!";"";"";
67319;"...You found Tarf?";"";"";
67333;"Would you...you know, GO GET HIM?!
Honestly, I can't believe you'd start
escorting a little boy, then run off!";"";"";
673a9;"He's probably waiting wherever
he lost sight of you.";"";"";
673e5;"I've always taught him that if he's
ever alone and there are no adults
around, he should just stay put.";"";"";
67453;"...You found Tarf?";"";"";
6746d;"Adol told Ruba that he
had rescued Tarf.";"";"";
6749d;"...What?! You just...
left him?!";"";"";
674c5;"Thank you, thank you, a thousand times
thank you! So...where is he? Did he
go back home already?";"";"";
6752d;"For true?!";"";"";
6753f;"Please, go back and get him!";"";"";
67563;"...Adol, there's no way a boy his age
could make it back home all on his own.
Not with all the demons out there!";"";"";
675db;"I'm counting on you, Adol.
Please, find Tarf for me.";"";"";
67617;"I'll keep up the act and report
that I didn't let you pass.";"";"";
67659;"Why not try asking
them about Tarf?";"";"";
67683;"If you were to transform into a Roo,
I'll bet you'd be able to understand
what the demons are saying.";"";"";
676ef;"#c2#Adol told the bridge guard
he knew about his son being
kidnapped by the man in black.";"";"";
6774f;"...It all started
two days ago.";"";"";

everything, then.";"";"";
677a1;"Wait...so that Roo was...?";"";"";
677c3;"For the time being, there's no
way to repair it, either. You
won't be able to get across.";"";"";
67823;"I'm sorry...but the bridge's
winch was broken by some
demons. It won't go down.";"";"";
67879;"I'm Ruba, the bridge
guard. And you are?";"";"";

son will be returned unharmed.";"";"";

the name of Adol will be
coming through here soon.";"";"";
67aa7;"Tarf...!";"";"";
67ab7;"You must have noticed how the villagers
have been regarding you, no? It's
because they all know what happened.";"";"";
67b2d;"...So Tarf was taken, and those
were the instructions for ensuring
his safe return.";"";"";
67b87;"Awww, how cute. It's a Roo!";"";"";
67ba9;"But then again, what do I know?";"";"";
67bcf;"I don't know, though...
You don't LOOK like a hero...";"";"";
67c0b;"Flonne has been saying you're
some kind of hero.";"";"";
67c43;"...Thank you. You're
a fine young man.";"";"";
67c71;"So, you managed to rescue Noit,
did you? I guess I didn't give
you enough credit.";"";"";
67cc9;"We can hear the ringing from Solomon
Shrine's bell tower all the way here.";"";"";
67d1b;"Noit's disappeared.
Hadn't you heard?";"";"";
67d47;"Though I guess it's kind of your fault
he was taken in the first place, but
still...you didn't do anything wrong.";"";"";
67dbf;"I hear you rescued Tarf.";"";"";
67ddf;"I'm busy right now.
You're in my way,
so go on, shoo!";"";"";
67e1b;"What're you looking at?";"";"";
67e39;"Are you the one...?";"";"";

Just waaaalk on by...";"";"";
67ea1;"Oh... Oh, my...";"";"";
67eb7;"...It's a Roo. Nothing to
worry about...";"";"";
67ee7;"...Or are you looking for Ruba? If so,
you'll find him at his house. Should be
there 'til his shift starts.";"";"";
67f59;"How do you like my work?
Want to be my protege?";"";"";
67f8f;"Truth be told, I've been the
bridge guard for 36 years now.";"";"";
67fd1;"If you keep your wits about you, any
and all problems you encounter can be
resolved with little effort.";"";"";
6803f;"Just clear your mind, and gaze upon
your surroundings. In no time at all,
your next move will become clear!";"";"";
680b1;"Greetings, little one. You seem
unsettled... What is it that
troubles you so?";"";"";
68105;"Outspoken, she is. But she
means well, and is really a
very sweet girl.";"";"";
68153;"You should have seen her face when I
told her what you did. She was beaming
from ear to ear!";"";"";
681b7;"Thank you for saving Tarf. Elle may not
have said anything...but that's just her
way. She's grateful as well, to be sure.";"";"";
68237;"Y...you're...!";"";"";
6824d;"Hmm? Ah, a Roo. How unusual!";"";"";
68271;"It could be the end of days for us all.
I should watch the events unfold from
the Ice Ridge of Noltia.";"";"";
682df;"If so, then we must be getting close
now. I wonder what the moment of
impact will be like...";"";"";
68343;"...And I swear, it looked as if Ys
were descending to the surface...";"";"";
6838f;"You know, when I was locked up in
the bell tower, all I could do was
gaze at the sky outside my window.";"";"";
683fd;"I know I should have tried to run,
but I just couldn't bring myself to
leave the safety of that room...";"";"";
6846b;"If not for you, there's
no telling what might've
happened to me!";"";"";
684b3;"I know I should have tried to run,
but I just couldn't bring myself to
leave the safety of that room...";"";"";
68521;"If not for you, there's
no telling what might've
happened to me.";"";"";
68569;"Man, thank you so much. Can't
believe I made it back here in
one piece!";"";"";
685b7;"Soothes the fire within,
you know?";"";"";
685e1;"I think that I might go to the
Ice Ridge to cool off for a bit.";"";"";
68627;"That's the problem with living
in a lava pit underground: no
weather. And it's soooooo hot!";"";"";
68689;"Probably somewhere isolated, away
from the prying eyes of demons...";"";"";
686d3;"As a result, they all scattered off,
going into hiding somewhere. I wonder
where they've gone?";"";"";
68739;"But they were cursed by the demons,
changing their appearance forever. Now,
people often mistake them for demons.";"";"";
687b1;"Roos used to be sacred creatures
in the Goddesses' service.";"";"";
687f3;"They're such cute little things--
curse or no. Wonder where they
all went...?";"";"";
68847;"As such, we almost never see
the Roos anymore...the 'Divine
Messengers,' if you will.";"";"";
688a3;"This area's swarming
with demons, too.";"";"";
688d1;"Yaaagh! Saaaaave meeee!";"";"";
688ef;"Apparently, they want to see
for themselves if Ys has truly
fallen back to the surface.";"";"";
6894d;"Noit and my husband are
talking about going off
somewhere again. *sigh*";"";"";
6899b;"So when something bad happens to Noit,
it's like something bad happening to a
member of the family.";"";"";
68a05;"My husband is a good
friend of his, you see.";"";"";
68a39;"I'm so glad Noit's been
returned to us, safe and
sound!";"";"";
68a77;"Isn't this a crazy place? Cold
outside, hot inside... Be careful
you don't get yourself sick!";"";"";
68adb;"Ah, so you've been to Ramia
Village, have you?";"";"";
68b11;"I know you've been put through
the wringer here, but just...
persevere. You shall be victorious.";"";"";
68b79;"You don't seem like such
a bad guy after all...";"";"";
68baf;"I really don't know if there's
anything we can do to stand up
to the demons...";"";"";
68c05;"If your cause is just, then I'm
certain the Goddesses will
protect and bless you.";"";"";
68c5d;"Red hair...";"";"";
68c6f;"I've heard that Roos aren't
actually demons at all...";"";"";
68cab;"...But, I mean, they're inhuman
creatures with human-like intelli-
gence. Isn't that...a demon?";"";"";
68d11;"Putting himself in that kind of
danger, in these demon-infested
environs? What a buffoon...";"";"";
68d73;"Noit just HAS to see with his
own eyes if Ys is really falling
back to the surface of the world.";"";"";
68ddb;"...I guess that's why I couldn't
find him at the Ice Ridge!";"";"";
68e1d;"Noit says he was captured, and
that the demons tossed him into
a cell in Solomon Shrine.";"";"";
68e7d;"I'm afraid the demons
may've gotten him...";"";"";
68eaf;"I went to the Ice Ridge to look
for him, but he was nowhere to
be found. Not a trace of him!";"";"";
68f13;"Eventually, he buckled down and did
it...and that was the last anyone's
seen of him!";"";"";
68f6f;"Noit is obsessed with cooling himself
down. He kept saying he should take a
walk along the Ice Ridge of Noltia...";"";"";
68fe7;"If true, then I can't help but feel
sorry for them. They shouldn't be
called demons at all.";"";"";
69049;"They were cursed long ago,
to look like monsters...but
they're very gentle creatures.";"";"";
690a5;"Noit was just telling me that the
Roos were once sacred animals.";"";"";
690ed;"I guess I AM being watched
when I'm there!";"";"";
6911f;"...Oh, there are Roos
hiding around there?
Well, that explains it!";"";"";
69169;"Anytime I go near that Goddess statue
at the entrance to the Ice Ridge, I
get the feeling I'm being watched...";"";"";
691df;"Gotta be something, though!
I wonder if there's some way
to lure it out...";"";"";
69231;"It's like there are demons
watching me...but it doesn't
really feel demonic.";"";"";
69285;"Anytime I go near that Goddess statue
at the entrance to the Ice Ridge, I
get the feeling I'm being watched...";"";"";
692fb;"I wonder if there's some way
to lure it out...";"";"";
69331;"Gotta be something, though!";"";"";
69353;"It was like there were demons
watching me...but it didn't
really feel demonic.";"";"";
693a9;"As I drew near it, I could swear
someone was watching me...";"";"";
693eb;"And you've seen that Goddess
statue there, right?";"";"";
69423;"Very odd. I was just at the entrance
to the Ice Ridge of Noltia, to cool
myself off...";"";"";
69481;"...Crono, was it?";"";"";
69499;"Wait... Don't tell me...
Man, I'm so bad at remembering
names...";"";"";
694e1;"...Ha! I'll take your silence
as a modest yes. Good for you!
Go get 'em, slugger!";"";"";
69539;"You're the hero the Goddesses
foretold, aren't you?";"";"";
69573;"I've been mulling this over,
ever since you rescued Tarf...";"";"";
695b5;"He says you're the one who rescued
him from his prison, after he was
captured by demons.";"";"";
69615;"Noit was missing for a good
long while, but he's finally
come back home.";"";"";
69665;"There's not a doubt in my mind that
everyone in the village wishes you
only the very best. Courage, Adol!";"";"";
696d5;"If you ever need a friendly ear, too,
I'll be happy to lend you mind. Drop
on by anytime you'd like!";"";"";
69741;"You should take a break from this hero
role of yours, every now and again.
You'll wear yourself out, if you don't!";"";"";
697bb;"You look awfully thin...
Have you not been eating well?";"";"";
697f9;"Oh, my, it certainly has
been a while.";"";"";
69827;"I'm so sorry to have given
you the cold shoulder before.";"";"";
69867;"I heard the news from Elle.";"";"";
69889;"You're the fellow who rescued Tarf
from the demons, are you not?";"";"";
698d1;"As am I. Thank you so much
for saving our little menace.";"";"";
69911;"She didn't want me to say anything
to you...but she was actually really
impressed by your actions.";"";"";
6997b;"I heard all about it from
his cousin, Elle.";"";"";
699ad;"So, you really did rescue Tarf...";"";"";
699d5;"Really...?";"";"";
699e7;"...Eh? You're going to
go rescue Tarf?";"";"";
69a15;"Please...save Tarf.
For his sake, and
for Ruba's.";"";"";
69a4d;"I c-can't talk to you right now.
Please, forgive me...";"";"";
69a8b;"Er, um...uh, sorry.";"";"";
69aa5;"Y-You're...!";"";"";
69ab9;"Demon? Pfah! I spit in the
faces of demons! Spit, spit!";"";"";
69af7;"I knew you had it in you, mister.
Man, I wanna go on an adventure
of my own someday!";"";"";
69b53;"Did you really rescue old Noit
from the demons' lair?";"";"";
69b8f;"Heh...I heard a rumor
about you, mister.";"";"";
69bbf;"I knew I should've gone to
Ramia Village with Tarf.";"";"";
69bf9;"*sigh*";"";"";
69c07;"When I grow up, I wanna go
and have adventures, too!";"";"";
69c43;"Boy, you sure are lucky, mister.";"";"";
69c6b;"When I'm grown up, I'm gonna be
just like you and make the village
safe from demons!";"";"";
69cc7;"When I'm grown up, I'm gonna be
just like you and make the village
safe from demons!";"";"";
69d23;"Thanks for rescuing Tarf.";"";"";
69d43;"I...uh...I'm really sorry I
said you were an outsider.";"";"";
69d81;"...Outsider.";"";"";
69d95;"...";"";"";
69d9f;"I'm dead. See? Dead!
So don't talk to me!";"";"";
69dcf;"Noit made it back to the
village. He says you were
the one who rescued him.";"";"";
69e21;"I could stand to learn
by your example.";"";"";
69e4f;"Glad he's finally got a good male role
model. Me, I've always been so busy and
haughty, he basically hates me!";"";"";
69ec5;"You're quite a guy. My son
practically worships the
ground you walk on.";"";"";
69f13;"Even with all the danger, he still
wanders around like he owns the
place. Makes me so worried!";"";"";
69f79;"If Ischt got captured too...I just
don't know how I would handle it!";"";"";
69fc5;"No sooner had I been thinking about
Tarf's safe return, than Noit does a
disappearing act of his own!";"";"";
6a031;"...So you actually saved Tarf.";"";"";
6a057;"...So you really did rescue Tarf.";"";"";
6a07f;"Still, it's because of you that he got
kidnapped in the first place. So aren't
we still in danger, with you around?";"";"";
6a0f9;"I hear if you play dead when the demons
come around, they'll leave you be.
Sounds pretty far-fetched, though.";"";"";
6a16d;"Wh-what if... What would I do if
MY son were to be taken away?!";"";"";
6a1b3;"Do you really intend
to rescue Tarf?";"";"";
6a1df;"...I heard you talking
with Ruba.";"";"";
6a207;"Tarf... I'll pray for your
safety, every day...";"";"";
6a23d;"...Staring? I wasn't
staring...";"";"";
6a263;"...!";"";"";
6a26f;"You're that skinny fella, Crono,
aren't you? Lived next door to me
20 years ago?";"";"";
6a2c7;"Can it really be you?
It's been a long time!";"";"";
6a2fb;"Oh, my my my!";"";"";
6a30f;"Were you training so you could protect
me? Such a manly man, you are!";"";"";
6a35b;"Haven't seen you for a long time...
but here you are! And you've grown
some serious muscles...";"";"";
6a3c1;"Huh...";"";"";
6a3cf;"If I were only ten years
younger, you wouldn't be
able to get rid of me!";"";"";
6a41f;"I go a little while without seeing you,
and you get all grown up on me!";"";"";
6a46d;"Huh...";"";"";
6a47b;"If you don't...well, I might
just have to club you and take
back to my cave! Ohh ho-ho-ho!";"";"";
6a4dd;"If you go now, you might
just make it...";"";"";
6a50d;"When did that snot-nosed kid I
once knew grow up into such a
fine, upstanding adult...?";"";"";
6a56b;"You've certainly grown since
last I saw you.";"";"";
6a59f;"Oh, my my my!";"";"";
6a5b3;"Come on, you don't have to be so
shy! But, I suppose you always were
a timid child...";"";"";
6a60f;"...Eh? I've mistaken you
for someone else, you say?";"";"";
6a649;"A red-haired...young man...";"";"";
6a66b;"You've already saved Tarf.
So I guess we don't have to
drive you away anymore!";"";"";
6a6c1;"...Eh?";"";"";
6a6cf;"Your head's so red... Is that
natural, or is that the blood
of your enemies...?";"";"";
6a725;"You...!";"";"";
6a733;"I think it was Ruba...
Something about Tarf...
Oh, I just can't remember!";"";"";
6a783;"...Actually, come to think of it,
didn't somebody say something about
a redhead just recently...?";"";"";
6a7eb;"That's your natural hair
color? Seriously?!";"";"";
6a81d;"G-g-good day to you.";"";"";
6a839;"I wonder what had them
so spooked...?";"";"";
6a865;"The pikkards were making a
lot of noise until just a
short while ago.";"";"";
6a8b1;"Probably got lost while he was out
walking, and wandered into their
territory or something...";"";"";
6a915;"What the heck did the demons
want with ol' Noit, though?!";"";"";
6a955;"The consummate hero, that's what
you are. Such an amazing lad!";"";"";
6a99b;"Haven't seen you in a while...
Oh? You rescued Noit, did you?";"";"";
6a9df;"You're looking well! ...And
speaking of wellness, where'd
Noit get himself off to?!";"";"";
6aa39;"There are demons all over creation,
and he decides to go take a walk?
What the hell was he thinking?!";"";"";
6aaa5;"I swear, that man's brain moves at
inhuman speeds, but his common sense
moves at SUBhuman speeds!";"";"";
6ab0d;"We can't let the demons run roughshod
over us anymore. We're going to show
them that we can protect our own!";"";"";
6ab81;"We can't let the demons run roughshod
over us anymore. We're going to show
them that we can protect our own!";"";"";
6abf5;"But, I mean, if you weren't such
a threat to them, Tarf would have
never been taken...you know?";"";"";
6ac5b;"...I'm really sorry. I know
that all of this is the demons'
fault, NOT yours.";"";"";
6acaf;"...I-I'm not here right now.
Leave a message, and I'll get
back to you...";"";"";
6acff;"Never venture outside alone. The demons'
numbers have been increasing lately. And
keep watch over your children!";"";"";
6ad77;"Never venture outside alone. The demons'
numbers have been increasing lately. And
keep watch over your children!";"";"";

Noit and Rafa";"";"";

Rex's House";"";"";

6ae77;"Thank goodness... Tarf,
you're not hurt? You're
all right?!";"";"";
6aeb9;"I AM kinda hungry, though...";"";"";
6aedd;"I'm fine. No big deal at all!
Not like I'm scared of the
demons even one little bit.";"";"";
6af39;"I see. Well, let's
get some food into
you, then!";"";"";
6af71;"Okay!";"";"";
6af7d;"I'm so sorry for what
I said to you before.";"";"";
6afaf;"As for you... I don't know
how I can ever thank you.";"";"";
6afeb;"I could've been left to
starve. And man, that would
be the worst fate of all!";"";"";
6b043;"If not for Mister Adol,
I don't know what would've
happened to me.";"";"";
6b091;"Well, this has been a real eye-opener
for me. We can't allow the demons to
keep doing things like this.";"";"";
6b0ff;"Heh.";"";"";
6b10b;"Time to lower that bridge!";"";"";
6b12d;"You show 'em, Dad!
Fight the machine!";"";"";
6b159;"You have someplace to be,
no? I'll lower the bridge
for you right away!";"";"";
6b1a7;"You all set to go?";"";"";
6b1c1;"Keep them. They may yet
serve you in your journey.";"";"";
6b1fb;"Oh, the #c2#Whisper Earrings#c#?";"";"";
6b223;"There we have it.";"";"";
6b23b;"Off you go, then!";"";"";

concentrated power of the land
of Ys.";"";"";

before...that I am actually one of the
twin Goddesses of Ys.";"";"";
6b375;"It's me, Feena.";"";"";
6b38b;"Oh, Adol. I've been hoping I would see
you again...";"";"";
6b3c5;"If magic itself is not eradicated,
this land will never know true peace.";"";"";
6b415;"Using magic to seal away the demons
guaranteed that the seal would,
eventually, be broken...";"";"";

magic in Ys. That is the demons' secret.";"";"";

by an unfathomably powerful energy.";"";"";
6b67b;"This is to be the final battle.";"";"";
6b6a1;"Adol, you have done well in getting this
far. I am Reah, Goddess of Ys.";"";"";
6b6ef;"You must somehow destroy the Black
Pearl. Please, wear my #c2#ring#c# during
the fight. It will weaken the demon.";"";"";
6b767;"We need the might of a swordsman to aid
us in this, our darkest hour...";"";"";
6b7b5;"We do not have the strength to re-seal
the demons on our own, I'm afraid...";"";"";
6b807;"Because of the magic this released,
Dark Fact was able to gain the edge
he needed to break the seal.";"";"";
6b873;"Hundreds of years passed in tranquility
until the day Cleria was excavated,
misidentified as silver...";"";"";
6b8e1;"The Cleria was born of the demons, you
see-- and of the magic-- and we deemed
its presence a hazard.";"";"";
6b94d;"When the demons were wiped out, we were
the ones who buried the Cleria deep
within the ground.";"";"";

Do not falter!";"";"";

6baa9;"Its sound will remove the
curse on the Goddesses.";"";"";

#c2#Silver Harmonica#c#.";"";"";
6bb13;"Not my turn yet.";"";"";
6bb2b;"I doubt you'll fool anyone with that
Roo form of yours anymore.";"";"";
6bb71;"Nice try, Adol, but the hair's
a dead giveaway.";"";"";
6bba7;"I brought you the #c2#Cleria Shield#c#. I think
you'll need it in the coming fight.";"";"";
6bc01;"It's me, Luta Gemma!";"";"";
6bc1d;"Adol, where've you been?";"";"";
6bc3d;"This is to be the last battle between
demon and human. Peace is within our
grasp!";"";"";
6bc95;"Adol, hurry up and play
the Silver Harmonica!";"";"";
6bcc9;"First, we must break the
seal on the Goddesses.";"";"";
6bcff;"Not my turn yet.";"";"";
6bd17;"I don't think so, demon!";"";"";
6bd3b;"I'm sorry to be so late, Adol. Quickly,
play this #c2#Silver Harmonica#c#! Its sound
will remove the curse on the Goddesses.";"";"";
6bdbf;"Ys is now back where it belongs. And the
Priests are in attendance! ...Or did you
forget that I'm a descendant of Tovah?";"";"";

6be5b;"What in the world...?";"";"";
6be77;"That's right, Tarf!";"";"";

6bee9;"Th-the demons...!";"";"";

6bf83;"Why are we all here...?";"";"";
6bfa1;"Tarf...";"";"";
6bfaf;"Keith...";"";"";
6bfbf;"...Adol, we'll be rooting
for you. Knock 'em dead,
man! ...Literally, if you can!";"";"";
6c017;"So...";"";"";
6c023;"We're here to
observe Adol's
fight.";"";"";
6c04d;"In light of that...we, too, must
stand and fight in our own way,
to lend him support!";"";"";
6c0a9;"Adol is marching alone
into a fearsome struggle.";"";"";
6c0e1;"Mister Gorto...";"";"";
6c0f7;"We may not be able to offer
direct assistance to Adol, but
that doesn't make us powerless...";"";"";
6c15b;"Pray for Ys...and for all the
world...to lend Adol strength.";"";"";
6c19f;"Let us pray for his success, then,
if we cannot fight by his side!";"";"";
6c1e9;"And you...should offer your prayers
to the surface world...the world to
which Ys is being returned!";"";"";
6c253;"...Okay!";"";"";
6c263;"Yes, let us pray. We shall pray
as we never have before. We shall
pray for unequivocal victory.";"";"";
6c2c9;"I'll pray for Adol to be granted the
knowledge and wisdom to overcome this
difficult trial!";"";"";
6c32b;"I will pray for the light
to illuminate the darkness
before him.";"";"";
6c373;"...that his resolve shall never
waver, and his heart shall never
falter.";"";"";
6c3c3;"I pray...";"";"";
6c3d3;"I guess that just leaves me...";"";"";
6c3f9;"I pray...that Adol's
sword be granted power
beyond power!";"";"";
6c439;"But there's something magical
about them that just fills me
with energy!";"";"";
6c489;"They grow all over
the field, so they're
not exactly rare...";"";"";
6c4cd;"I love Marle Flowers.";"";"";
6c4e9;"...That's about all we know on the
subject of Solomon Shrine, though,
here in Lance. It's a mystery to us!";"";"";
6c55b;"On that distant summit, in Solomon
Shrine, sits the Goddesses' Palace,
where they supposedly lived.";"";"";
6c5c5;"We see it all the time
from the plains, but
we've never been there...";"";"";
6c611;"I wonder what the area
around Solomon Shrine
is actually like...";"";"";
6c659;"Ah, Adol. Hello, there!";"";"";
6c677;"It's my absolute favorite spot.";"";"";
6c69d;"Isn't this a wonderful place?";"";"";
6c6c1;"I mean, looking at Ys from this
vantage point, it just seems so
peaceful and inviting...";"";"";
6c721;"I have to wonder where the
demons originated from.";"";"";
6c75b;"Adol, look there...
across the field.";"";"";
6c787;"And the building on top of the Ice
Ridge is Solomon Shrine, where the
Goddesses used to live.";"";"";
6c7eb;"Do you see that frozen cliff?
That's the Ice Ridge of Noltia.";"";"";
6c82f;"I wonder what it's like...";"";"";
6c851;"We've only ever seen it from
here... None of us have ever
actually gone there.";"";"";
6c8a7;"...Well, I'm off to pick
flowers. Take care, Adol!";"";"";
6c8e1;"Don't look, don't
touch, and stay
back!";"";"";
6c90f;"What's with you? You're
way too close for comfort!";"";"";
6c949;"One side! Comin' through!";"";"";
6c969;"Hey! I have the right of way
here, bub! Step aside!";"";"";
6c9a3;"I'm fat because I'm lazy...";"";"";
6c9c5;"Well you're certainly an
odd-lookin' one...";"";"";
6c9f7;"If you have no business
here, then go away!";"";"";
6ca29;"Who really cares, though?
I mean, we're pretty much
invincible!";"";"";
6ca6f;"I hear there's an intruder
in the Shrine. Boss-man's
makin' a big fuss about it.";"";"";
6cac7;"Supposedly, there's been an
intruder. You think it's a
human?";"";"";
6cb0b;"Go back to your post!";"";"";
6cb27;"Hey! What do you
think you're doing?!";"";"";
6cb53;"No time to talk now.
Go about your business.";"";"";
6cb87;"...Have we met before?";"";"";
6cba5;"Everybody else is making fun of
him, but I don't see what the big
deal is. Redhead guy's just strong!";"";"";
6cc11;"Looks like Druegar got
taken out by that
redhead.";"";"";
6cc49;"Why, it's Lord Druegar's chamber!";"";"";
6cc71;"What is this place, you ask?";"";"";
6cc95;"Haven't seen you around before.";"";"";
6ccbb;"...Nice try. But I know who you are.";"";"";
6cce7;"I suggest that you take your leave...
quickly.";"";"";
6cd1d;"Opposing us in your human form would be
foolish, at best...";"";"";
6cd5f;"I should warn you, red-haired
swordsman...";"";"";
6cd91;"I suggest that you take your leave...
quickly.";"";"";
6cdc7;"Opposing us as you are would be foolish,
at best...";"";"";
6ce01;"This is as far as you go, Adol
Christin...";"";"";
6ce33;"...Fool.";"";"";
6ce43;"So you reject my offer...? I
extend to you my good will,
and you would spit on me?";"";"";
6ce9d;"This form is most appropriate
for one who would so readily
dance at the Goddesses' whim.";"";"";
6cefd;"May you live out your days as
that which you have struggled
against for so long...";"";"";
6cf57;"If you will take your leave,
I will forgive your trespass.";"";"";
6cf99;"Adol cannot enter the main building
of the Shrine without it.";"";"";
6cfdd;"This information must not leave this
room: It's been transferred to the
west sector of the Subterranean Canal.";"";"";
6d053;"Adol doesn't know that
the Goddesses' Pendant
has been moved.";"";"";
6d097;"This area was once under the juris-
diction of Priest Dabbie. How do I
know that? ...Because I'm awesome!";"";"";
6d107;"...Or so I've been told. But
really, who cares? Isn't that
ancient history at this point?";"";"";
6d167;"This area was supposedly once
under Priest Dabbie's
jurisdiction.";"";"";
6d1af;"Not even one such as Mistress
Zava is exempt from that rule.";"";"";
6d1f3;"Heh... The weak are weeded
out, and their bodies become
food for the strong.";"";"";
6d247;"They're currently in conference,
discussing a plan to get rid of
the intruder.";"";"";
6d29d;"She's actually out at the moment.
She's in the northern reception
hall right now.";"";"";
6d2f5;"...What? You have something
to report to her?";"";"";
6d329;"This is Mistress
Zava's bedroom.";"";"";
6d351;"Didn't I already give you the
pass? Quickly, get to the
northern reception hall!";"";"";
6d3ad;"Anything to nip this problem
in the bud, you know?";"";"";
6d3eb;"He is priority one right now,
after all, so any information
you can provide, we'll welcome.";"";"";
6d451;"...An urgent matter regarding Adol,
you say? Very well, then. I'll issue
you a pass to get through security.";"";"";
6d4c9;"What's that? A report for Mistress Zava?
I'm afraid she's attending a conference
in the northern reception hall...";"";"";
6d547;"I'm not your enemy. It's okay
to talk to me in human form.";"";"";
6d589;"This is the entrance to the bell tower,
known as the Campanile of Lane. And the
sacrificial ritual is beginning.";"";"";
6d601;"It's me, Keith.";"";"";
6d617;"You need to save that poor, innocent
girl in my place, Adol. Please.";"";"";
6d663;"Zava is lying in wait at the entrance...
but I'm not strong enough to fight her.";"";"";
6d6bb;"On the fifth toll, the girl, Maria, will
die.";"";"";
6d6ef;"What to do, what to do...
Don't talk to me! You're
not helping!";"";"";
6d735;"Directions? I don't know...
Go ask someone else!";"";"";
6d76d;"#c2#Two guards could be heard
conversing outside.";"";"";
6d7a5;"#c2#Two guards could be heard speaking
to one another in the language of
the demons.";"";"";
6d801;"We've finally got the traitor, Keith,
cornered down below. It's just a matter
of time until we catch him, now...";"";"";
6d879;"You look mighty suspicious.
Almost like a human...";"";"";
6d8b3;"...I don't like you.";"";"";
6d8cf;"Ugh, this does NOT bode
well for ANY of us...";"";"";
6d903;"You mean to tell me that
you've been chosen as a
Shrine guard? YOU?";"";"";
6d94d;"You kind of smell like
a human...";"";"";
6d975;"...I think, anyway. What
does fish smell like, again?";"";"";
6d9b1;"You smell like fish.";"";"";
6d9cd;"Huh? Aren't you...?";"";"";
6d9e7;"Haven't I seen you
somewhere before?";"";"";
6da13;"Who are you? Ain't seen
you 'round these parts
afore...";"";"";
6da51;"This is no place for
outsiders. Get lost!";"";"";
6da81;"You're just a little pup! What
is this effort coming to, if we
need to start hiring children?!";"";"";
6dae7;"*yaaaawwn*
...I'm so sleepy!";"";"";
6db0b;"Well, YOU look suspicious. That
tuft of red hair... Are you Adol
in disguise?! *laughs*";"";"";
6db69;"Y'know... You seem like you're
having way too much fun. Shouldn't
you be working?";"";"";
6dbc1;"That empty room over there is
my bedroom. I called it, so
you can't have it!";"";"";
6dc15;"The empty room over there is actually
my bathroom. That's what I've been using
it for, anyway!";"";"";
6dc7b;"All these rooms, and every one
of 'em is totally empty!";"";"";
6dcb9;"This place has a rather slummy
vibe, doesn't it?";"";"";
6dcf1;"I swear, someday I'll
go traveling.";"";"";
6dd1b;"This place is basically unused.
It's pretty much a bunch of
closets!";"";"";
6dd67;"Why are the humans
here?";"";"";
6dd87;"These fruits are so yummy, I
just can't stop eating them!";"";"";
6ddc7;"Mmmmm! Delicious!
Absolutely amazing!";"";"";
6ddf3;"I know I should've been watching
more carefully, but...another fruit's
been taken by the human.";"";"";
6de59;"Wasn't you, was it?";"";"";
6de73;"Someone's been stealing all
the fruit we've gathered.";"";"";
6deaf;"Someone's been eating all
our fruit!";"";"";
6dedb;"Dammit! It's gone again!";"";"";
6defb;"Were more fruits randomly eaten?
I swear, we just can't seem to
get the situation under control!";"";"";
6df63;"Don't you think this Shrine is
too big? It's way too easy to
get lost in here!";"";"";
6dfb9;"...I think I'm lost. Ahh, whatever.
Not like I have any place to be,
you know?";"";"";
6e00f;"This Shrine is way too huge. And its
layout seems so random and haphazard!
It's so 24 years ago...";"";"";
6e079;"How do you get to the main area of the
Shrine? Pfft... How the hell would I
know?! I don't even know where I am!";"";"";
6e0f1;"Main building? What, is food served
there or something?";"";"";
6e12f;"...And, uh, haven't I seen
you around before?";"";"";
6e163;"If you have the pendant, you
can reach the inner Shrine.";"";"";
6e1a3;"...Though you didn't hear that
from me, capish?";"";"";
6e1d9;"They're marked by the pendants
worn around their necks.";"";"";
6e217;"The central Shrine is only open
to specific people.";"";"";
6e251;"...So why wasn't I chosen?
Am I not good enough?!";"";"";
6e289;"I hear that only 'chosen' ones
get to enter the Central Shrine.";"";"";
6e2cf;"What's that? A hotel
or something?";"";"";
6e2f9;"Central Shrine?";"";"";
6e30f;"Do you have the pendant?
Ah, okay. Just checking.";"";"";
6e347;"But now...it's under MY jurisdiction!";"";"";
6e373;"This area was supposedly once
under Priest Dabbie's
jurisdiction.";"";"";
6e3bb;"...Aren't I smart? Isn't it awesome
that I know that?";"";"";
6e3f7;"Dabbie was one of the
six Priests of Ys.";"";"";
6e427;"...Or so I've been told.
But what does it matter?
That was a long time ago!";"";"";
6e479;"Priest Dabbie once controlled
this area.";"";"";
6e4a9;"None are allowed past this point
unless they know the password.";"";"";
6e4ef;"So stop wandering around,
if you know what's good
for you!";"";"";
6e531;"Nope, that's not it.
Who are you, and what
are you up to?!";"";"";
6e573;"That's the one. I'll open
the gate for you right away.";"";"";
6e5b1;"If you find him, report back
immediately!";"";"";
6e5e1;"The sacrificial human has escaped,
and seems to be hiding out in the
Subterranean Canal.";"";"";
6e641;"#C0#Now, about those
countermeasures...#C#";"";"";
6e677;"#C0#Yep, as long as we keep that to
ourselves, he can't possibly get
anywhere important!#C#";"";"";
6e6dd;"#C0#...The intruder, yes...#C#";"";"";
6e707;"#C0#...No, you see, if this is
allowed to continue......#C#";"";"";
6e74d;"#C0#Regarding the present situation,
I believe we can...#C#";"";"";
6e793;"#C0#...But, we don't know for
certain...#C#";"";"";
6e7c9;"#C2#A voice echoes out from within,
demanding you identify yourself.";"";"";
6e815;"How will you respond?";"";"";
6e831;"I don't know.";"";"";

6e8e3;"What's the password?";"";"";
6e8ff;"Without the password,
you may not proceed.";"";"";
6e931;"If you find them, report back
immediately!";"";"";
6e963;"The sacrificial humans have escaped,
and seem to be hiding out in the
Subterranean Canal.";"";"";
6e9c3;"Heard a human managed to sneak in here.
Probably some bald marine or something.
That seems like the norm these days.";"";"";
6ea3f;"Adol's a pretty wussy name,
don't you think?";"";"";
6ea73;"It's kind of hard, though,
to notice something like
that. Humans all look alike...";"";"";
6eacd;"If you see a human with red
hair, that's Adol.";"";"";
6eb03;"We should search every demon that comes
through here. Eventually, one of them
would be Adol, and we'd kill him! Done!";"";"";
6eb7f;"Supposedly, Adol can disguise himself
as a demon. So what's the point in
setting up blockades?";"";"";
6ebe5;"This blockade is all Adol's fault. I
left something behind on the other side
of the gate, and now I can't go get it!";"";"";
6ec61;"This whole area is my turf now.
If you don't like it, I suggest
you leave.";"";"";
6ecb3;"This area belongs
to Mistress Zava.";"";"";
6ecdd;"But since Mistress Zava isn't
around anymore, I think I'll just
take it for myself!";"";"";
6ed37;"This area was under Mistress
Zava's control.";"";"";
6ed6b;"What are you doing in Mistress
Zava's precinct?";"";"";
6eda1;"To defeat even Mistress Zava...
Is this Adol guy REALLY human?!";"";"";
6ede7;"I'm hungry...and you
look pretty tasty.
GET IN MAH BELLY!";"";"";
6ee27;"Mistress Zava...was so very, very
beautiful. But she's been cut down,
in the prime of her life. So sad...";"";"";
6ee97;"Mistress Zava is a
real looker, don't
you think?";"";"";
6eecf;"I can't believe a mere human
would be able to take down
Mistress Zava... It's unthinkable!";"";"";
6ef31;"This is Mistress Zava's
precinct. Are you lost?";"";"";
6ef67;"Heh... Not anymore, though!";"";"";
6ef89;"This building belonged to
Mistress Zava.";"";"";
6efb9;"This is Mistress
Zava's room.";"";"";
6efdd;"Hey, you! What do you think
you're doing?!";"";"";
6f00f;"If you have no business here,
you'd best mosey along!";"";"";
6f04b;"The demons around here are real brutes.
A small fellow like you should probably
get out while the getting's good!";"";"";
6f0c3;"You look scrumptious...";"";"";
6f0e1;"I'm so hungry... I should
eat me a good old-fashioned
Roo-burger! Yesiree!";"";"";
6f133;"Are you...on the clock?";"";"";
6f151;"What do you want?! Look,
I'm busy! Come back later!";"";"";
6f18b;"Quit loitering!";"";"";
6f1a1;"Hey, where do you think you're going?!
This is the publishing house for our
gate passes! NO ROOS!";"";"";
6f209;"What you doing?! Get back to
your post at once!";"";"";
6f23f;"Why do we all need
separate passes?";"";"";
6f269;"Quit wandering around! Can't
you just behave yourself?!";"";"";
6f2a7;"You're going to get in trouble, you
know. The gate passes are produced up
ahead, and it's REALLY off-limits.";"";"";
6f31b;"Quit wandering around. Adol's gotten
us all a little jumpy. Startle us
enough, and we'll bite back!";"";"";
6f385;"All right, go on in!";"";"";
6f3a1;"But when you're done, get
back to your post, pronto!";"";"";
6f3dd;"There's some big meeting going on up
ahead. If you don't have a pass, you
aren't getting in. Period.";"";"";
6f449;"...Passes, please.";"";"";
6f463;"Adol heard voices coming
from within.";"";"";
6f48f;"It sounded as if no one could
see eye to eye, and nothing was
being settled.";"";"";
6f4e3;"Adol heard voices coming
from within.";"";"";
6f50f;"Adol heard voices coming
from within.";"";"";
6f53b;"If Adol should get his hands on
it, there's no telling how much
trouble he'd cause...";"";"";
6f597;"That, by itself, wouldn't be such
a problem, but they also got away
with the #c2#Shrine Key.#c#";"";"";
6f5fd;"The intended sacrifices
have escaped.";"";"";
6f629;"One misstep on his part,
and we will have him!";"";"";
6f65f;"The entire Shrine has been placed on
high alert, so that we may capture this
red-haired swordsman...";"";"";
6f6cb;"They've been quiet since their escape,
too. No sign of their presence that
we've been able to detect.";"";"";
6f737;"But they were too
faint to make out.";"";"";
6f763;"Adol heard voices.";"";"";
6f77d;"But Adol couldn't make out any specifics
on what was being said.";"";"";
6f7c5;"Whatever was being discussed in that
room, the proceedings had become quite
intense.";"";"";
6f821;"Sounds like it's getting
pretty nasty in there.";"";"";
6f857;"That's what one of our own's last
words were, anyway, after Adol gave
him a mortal wound.";"";"";
6f8b7;"They say that Adol fellow's hair is red
because of all the demon blood. And that
his armor's stained in it, too.";"";"";
6f92f;"You want a taste of my
sickle? It can be a
practice run for Adol!";"";"";
6f977;"Get out of my way! Shoo!";"";"";
6f997;"If you see him, you're to
report in immediately!";"";"";
6f9cf;"Supposedly, Adol's vanished.";"";"";
6f9f3;"If you see Adol...
kill him!";"";"";
6fa17;"No one escapes my blade...
not Adol, nor anyone else!";"";"";
6fa53;"The meetings here tend to
take forever these days.";"";"";
6fa8d;"They're gonna be in there
for a while, I think...";"";"";
6fac5;"Adol is stronger than us,
plain and simple. So we
just have to work out!";"";"";
6fb15;"They never seem to come to
any decisive conclusions.
It's a waste of time!";"";"";
6fb67;"Why do they even bother
having meetings?";"";"";
6fb97;"The blockade hasn't solved our
problems. If anything, it's only
made things worse!";"";"";
6fbf1;"I hope they come up with
SOME kind of plan in that
meeting.";"";"";
6fc33;"He brought up some motion that
needed a vote or something...
I dunno, I hate politics.";"";"";
6fc91;"Have you heard? Apparently,
Lord Dalles is the reason the
meeting's taking so long.";"";"";
6fceb;"My money's on Mistress Zava.
All the time with her, it's
just yak, yak, yak...";"";"";
6fd41;"Who do you think is making
this meeting drag on?";"";"";
6fd79;"Every time there's a meeting in the
conference room, it goes on FOREVER.
Demons can be really obstinate, y'know?";"";"";
6fdf1;"There's no one in the conference
room at the moment. So why do you
want to go in there?";"";"";
6fe4f;"A very important meeting is
in progress right now.";"";"";
6fe89;"What business do you have in
there? ...I don't trust you.";"";"";
6fec9;"There's a meeting in progress,
so keep your squeaking down!";"";"";
6ff0b;"What's on the agenda
for today?";"";"";
6ff31;"It's usually Mistress Zava.
Good thing I'm not a betting
man, or I'd've lost this one!";"";"";
6ff8f;"Hah, seems Dalles is the one
responsible for this meeting
dragging on and on.";"";"";
6ffe3;"If Lord Dalles were here, he'd
keep the discussion on track!";"";"";
70027;"Mistress Zava's probably
padding it out with gossip
and crazy theories.";"";"";
70075;"Looks like we're in for another
long, drawn-out meeting...";"";"";
700b7;"And everybody's up in arms, now,
too, on account of that redhead.
If I ever got ahold of him...";"";"";
7011d;"Mistress Zava is super-persistent.
When she decides to really argue a
point, there's no talking her down.";"";"";
7018d;"Lord Dalles is the perfect balance for
her, as he absolutely can't stand idle
chatter. It's all business, with him.";"";"";
70207;"She doesn't listen to anything anyone
else has to say, and as soon as she
starts talking, she never stops!";"";"";
70279;"Mistress Zava's probably
dragging out the meeting.";"";"";
702b3;"But I suppose I shouldn't doubt
my compatriots unless there's a
good reason. So greetings, brother!";"";"";
7031d;"You don't look at all familiar.
In fact, I'd even say you look
kind of suspicious...";"";"";
70379;"You're...awfully cute. You know,
I hear Roos can do some amazing
things with their pouches...";"";"";
703dd;"You know what Keith looks
like? 'Cause I sure don't!";"";"";
70419;"State your name!";"";"";
70431;"You're not Keith? ...You're Adol,
you say? Hmmm... I feel as if I've
heard that name somewhere before...";"";"";
704a1;"Are you...Keith?";"";"";
704b9;"...No, of course you're not. I just
thought maybe I could catch you off
guard if you were.";"";"";
7051b;"Many of my comrades have been
killed recently. Watch your
back, or you could be next!";"";"";
70577;"Adol's been on some kind of
rampage lately. If I see him,
I'll make him regret it!";"";"";
705d1;"Been a lot of us killed lately. Figured
I'd be dead by now, too. Say what anyone
will, that Adol guy can really cut!";"";"";
7064d;"You're in the way. Move it.";"";"";
7066f;"Stop wandering aimlessly like that. No
one's going to help you if you get lost.
...Mostly because we're all lost, too!";"";"";
706ed;"Word is, Adol's gone into a murderous
rampage. It's WAY too dangerous to stay
here... I wanna go somewhere isolated!";"";"";
70769;"Quit wandering around like an idiot.
If you should happen to run into Adol,
you'll be one cute, dead little critter!";"";"";
707e5;"What, are you lost? Wait your turn.
Someone will be with you in six to
eight weeks.";"";"";
7083f;"I've heard that the madman Adol
has been spotted in this area.
I don't want to die yet!";"";"";
7089d;"You just watch. I swear,
it'll be me!";"";"";
708c9;"The one who finally takes Adol
out will be sure to get a big
promotion, I bet.";"";"";
7091f;"But I'd rather spill blood
than have my blood spilled!";"";"";
7095d;"I have no love for
meaningless battle.";"";"";
7098b;"...Where I at?";"";"";
709a1;"Having no sense of direction
is even worse than it sounds.";"";"";
709e3;"Damn that Adol... I'll bet he's
hiding, because he's too scared
of me to fight!";"";"";
70a39;"Don't lose your head.
If you need to run, RUN!";"";"";
70a6f;"'Find Keith,' they tell me. But how
do I do that, when I don't even know
what Keith looks like?!";"";"";
70ad7;"You go hunt down Keith, too!
This ain't break time!";"";"";
70b11;"This hunt is a joke. The only way we
could really be sure we get him is to
kill every demon with green skin!";"";"";
70b85;"Ehh, I guess sometimes,
it's best not to ask.";"";"";
70bb9;"Isn't Keith a demon?
So why are we hunting
him down...?";"";"";
70bf7;"Shouldn't make a difference if just
one were to goof off...right? I mean,
no one could POSSIBLY notice...";"";"";
70c67;"There sure are a lot of
full-grown demons on this
hunt!";"";"";
70ca5;"But he managed to escape
through here.";"";"";
70cd3;"I chased Keith down this way
a little while ago.";"";"";
70d0b;"The key to the Water Control Room is
missing. I wonder if Keith took it...";"";"";
70d5d;"What's that? You beat Adol?
And this is your proof?!";"";"";
70d99;"What do you want?";"";"";
70db5;"#c2#Adol showed his own equipment
to the guards.";"";"";
70df1;"I don't know what it's called. But
it's #c2#east#c# from the Shrine entrance.
Got that?";"";"";
70e4f;"It's on the third floor of that...
building...oh, what is it?...the one
Priest Mesa used to govern!";"";"";
70eb9;"Do you know where Mistress
Zava's room is?";"";"";
70eeb;"All right, nice work! Go
and report this at once!";"";"";
70f23;"...Hmm. It does match
with the description
we were given...";"";"";
70f65;"Maybe now we'll finally have
some peace. Go on, you should
report this right away!";"";"";
70fbf;"...";"";"";
70fc9;"You're an awfully busy
little chap, aren't you?";"";"";
70fff;"It's you again.";"";"";
71015;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
71031;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
7104d;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
71069;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
71085;"You're an awfully busy
little chap, aren't you?";"";"";
710bb;"It's you again.";"";"";
710d1;"What was it, you ask? Beats me...
Something extremely important,
that's all I know.";"";"";
7112b;"Lord #c2#Dalles#c# apparently recovered
something that brought the meeting
to a sudden close...";"";"";
71191;"The meeting's finally over.";"";"";
711b3;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
711cf;"You...should be in there already...
...Maybe I was just distracted! I
hope Lord Dalles doesn't find out...";"";"";
71241;"Wait... How come you need to get back
in, when I never saw you come out?!";"";"";
71291;"Ah, it's you again. You're an awfully
busy little chap, aren't you?";"";"";
712db;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
712f7;"You're an awfully busy
little chap, aren't you?";"";"";
7132d;"It's you again.";"";"";
71343;"I don't know what it's called. But
it's #c2#east#c# from the Shrine entrance.
Got that?";"";"";
713a1;"It's on the third floor of that...
building...oh, what is it?...the one
Priest Mesa used to govern!";"";"";
7140b;"Do you know where Mistress
Zava's room is?";"";"";
7143d;"...";"";"";
71447;"What was it, you ask? Beats me...
Something extremely important,
that's all I know.";"";"";
714a1;"Lord #c2#Dalles#c# apparently recovered
something that brought the meeting
to a sudden close...";"";"";
71507;"The meeting's finally over.";"";"";
71529;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
71545;"You...should be in there already...
...Maybe I was just distracted! I
hope Lord Dalles doesn't find out...";"";"";
715b7;"Wait... How come you need to get back
in, when I never saw you come out?!";"";"";
71607;"Ah, it's you again. You're an awfully
busy little chap, aren't you?";"";"";
71651;"All right, go on in.";"";"";
7166d;"You're an awfully busy
little chap, aren't you?";"";"";
716a3;"Ah, it's you again.";"";"";
716bd;"Maybe now we'll finally have
some peace. Go on, you should
report this right away!";"";"";
71717;"I hate all this fighting...";"";"";
71739;"My stomach feels like it's tying
itself in knots!";"";"";
71771;"So, what's new?";"";"";
71787;"I hate all this fighting...";"";"";
717a9;"My stomach feels like it's tying
itself in knots!";"";"";
717e1;"So, what's new?";"";"";
717f7;"I hate all this fighting...";"";"";
71819;"My stomach feels like it's tying
itself in knots!";"";"";
71851;"So, what's new?";"";"";
71867;"Is it just me, or has it gotten
a whole lot colder...?";"";"";
718a5;"Brrrrr!";"";"";
718b3;"Whoa! I've never seen a demon
like THIS one before!";"";"";
718ed;"I was born and raised in the
Colony of Lava, after all!";"";"";
7192b;"Where are you going? It's way
too cold for me to go that way!";"";"";
7196f;"Now hold on, mister!";"";"";
7198b;"Do you want me to catch cold?!";"";"";
719b1;"Tarf is no longer following you!";"";"";
719d9;"We control the flow of time.";"";"";
719fd;"Uh...";"";"";
71a0d;"...Mister Adol? Don't you think...#w10#
you're crowding me a little?";"";"";
71a5d;"#c2#A design is etched into the
door, resembling a hydra.
It seems to be locked.";"";"";
71ab5;"Need the elder's permission
to let you in, though.";"";"";
71af3;"The abandoned mine is
right through here.";"";"";
71b27;"#R#you1are1ninja#R#";"";"";
71b41;"Whoa!";"";"";
71b4d;"What the...?!";"";"";
71b61;"I think I should run...";"";"";
71b7f;"Hee?!";"";"";
71b8b;"Go away!";"";"";
71b9b;"Goddesses~!";"";"";
71bad;"I'll fight, too!";"";"";
71bc5;"I've been hit...";"";"";
71bdd;"I'm sorry...";"";"";
71bf1;"That's...all I...";"";"";
71c09;"I'll knock 'em dead!";"";"";
71c25;"I ain't afraid of no monsters!";"";"";
71c4b;"Hee hee!";"";"";
71c5b;"Mister, you're super-cool!";"";"";
71c7d;"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";"";"";
71cf1;"Bat your eyes a little, though,
and maybe I can pretend...";"";"";
71d33;"Of course, it'd be even better if it
were from a girl...but I'll take what
I can get!";"";"";
71d8f;"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";"";"";
71e03;"Also probably shouldn't let down my
guard to rummage through my stuff.
Perhaps if you'd come back later?";"";"";
71e73;"I'd like to repay you, but I don't
really have anything to give.";"";"";
71ebb;"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";"";"";
71f2f;"I'll have to keep thinking. Sorry to
keep you in suspense, but I promise
you, it'll be worth it in the end!";"";"";
71fa1;"...And I think you might be
a little young for that!";"";"";
71fdd;"I've been trying to think of something
to give you in return, but all I can
offer you are Zalem's measurements...";"";"";
72055;"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";"";"";
720c9;"I'll keep at it, though! Sooner
or later, she'll be needing a
new suit tailored. Heh heh heh...";"";"";
7212f;"...And sadly, the good miss has been
on her guard around me lately, so my
attempts at measurement have all failed.";"";"";
721a9;"I've been wracking my brain for a good
gift to give you in return, but all I
can think about is Zalem's physique!";"";"";
72221;"Thank you. It means a lot to receive
a gift from someone. Standing guard
like this is a pretty thankless job.";"";"";
72295;"So what do you think?
Am I awesome, or what?";"";"";
722c9;"Zalem's a cool 36-22-35. Pretty amazing,
no? She didn't make it easy to find that
out, either, let me tell you!";"";"";
7233f;"And guess what? I did it!";"";"";
7235f;"...You know, demons aren't the only
dangerous things in the world.";"";"";
723a9;"Adol Christins are pretty dangerous
as well. And no gift is going to
change my mind about that.";"";"";
7240f;"I appreciate the gift, but I do
NOT appreciate the fireballs.
Keep that in mind, okay?";"";"";
7246d;"Oh! Oh, Goddesses, no!";"";"";
7248b;"...Thank you very much.
I greatly appreciate that
you thought of me.";"";"";
724d7;"Thank you so much
for being so kind!";"";"";
72503;"Th-thank you...";"";"";
72519;"May the blessings of the Goddesses
be with you always!";"";"";
72557;"When thinking of all the hazards I
might encounter in my lifetime, never
did random fireballs cross my mind.";"";"";
725cb;"Please try to be more careful
in the future, though, okay?";"";"";
7260d;"But I suppose I'll accept this
as an apology, and forget it just
this one time.";"";"";
72663;"Please, do be more
careful next time!";"";"";
7268f;"What in the name of the
Goddesses are you doing?!";"";"";
726c7;"Oh, for me? Thank you! In return,
please allow me to offer you some
guidance on your journey.";"";"";
7272b;"Still, it's not unreasonable to believe
that there may be some trace of those
powers left within our humble village...";"";"";
727a9;"Of course, in 700 years, the Priests'
bloodlines have likely become diluted,
and their powers lost.";"";"";
72813;"Indeed, if we were to research family
trees around here, some would surely
trace back to the Priests themselves.";"";"";
7288b;"It's been 700 years since then, but
Ramia is still a seat of strong beliefs
in the Goddesses and the six magics.";"";"";
72903;"This village has a long history, dating
back to the time before Ys was lifted
into the sky.";"";"";
72965;"For me? Thank you muchly!
Please, allow me to give you
some information in return.";"";"";
729bf;"I heard about it from their father,
but he passed away quite some time
ago. And so, too, have they...";"";"";
72a2b;"Supposedly, the siblings who lived
in the house next door were descended
from one of the six Priests of Ys.";"";"";
72a9d;"Oh, is this for me?
Mighty kind of you!
Care for more info?";"";"";
72adf;"If true, that would mean the Goddesses
are probably the only ones who would
know how to exterminate them.";"";"";
72b4f;"Indeed, I feel that the demons we
see now and the demons that appeared
in Ys 700 years ago must be connected.";"";"";
72bc3;"I'll likely never know the reason
for certain, but I have my own
theories regarding their Ys Origin.";"";"";
72c2f;"I've been thinking a lot about the
demons recently-- specifically, how
they came to be.";"";"";
72c8d;"Oh-ho, for me? You really are far too
kind! Let's see, what little tidbits
do I have for you today..?";"";"";
72cf9;"I think it's up to each of us to
consider questions like these, and
find our own answers.";"";"";
72d59;"And why do the demons exist, for that
matter? Is there a purpose? And if so,
does anyone know what it is?";"";"";
72dc9;"All I really have to offer is a bit of
philosophical musing. Why are we born
into this world? Why do we exist?";"";"";
72e3f;"Ah, a gift? Thank you, thank you!
Allow me to give you some friendly
advice today, if you would.";"";"";
72ea7;"This applies to me as well. But I see
you're trying to make amends, so I'll
trust that you've gotten the message!";"";"";
72f1f;"It's basically common sense, but
when you set someone on fire, THEY
ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.";"";"";
72f81;"Ah, a gift? Thank you, thank you!
Allow me to give you some friendly
advice today, if you would.";"";"";
72fe9;"One leaves a good impression with good
deeds. One rarely EVER leaves a good
impression, however, with FIREBALLS.";"";"";
73061;"Man down! MAN DOWN!";"";"";
7307b;"...You're a good lad, giving a
gift to an old dotard like me.";"";"";
730bf;"As thanks, you may have
unrestricted access to the
well in my basement.";"";"";
7310d;"You're a very kind young lad,
to bring me a gift.";"";"";
73145;"...In exchange, how about I just
pass on all the life lessons I've
learned in my years? Let's see...";"";"";
731b1;"If not for all the demons, I
could show you around Solomon
Shrine in return...";"";"";
73207;"You're a good lad, giving a gift
to an old dotard like me.";"";"";
73249;"Today, I'll tell you all about the
many ups and downs of my life...
One hundred tales of battle!";"";"";
732b1;"You're a good lad, giving a gift
to an old dotard like me.";"";"";
732f3;"Today, I shall regale you with one
hundred tales of my myriad love
affairs-- withholding no details!";"";"";
7335f;"You're a good lad, giving a gift
to an old dotard like me.";"";"";
733a1;"Today, I'll fill you in on my rise
to glory in life, leaving no detail
of the journey untold!";"";"";
73405;"...Shame on you for striking
an old man like me! It's hard
enough keeping cool around here!";"";"";
73467;"Nowadays, all you whippersnappers are
nothing but a bunch of hooligans, who
throw fireballs and mess up my lawn!";"";"";
734df;"...Though I suppose even
a weak apology is better
than none at all...";"";"";
7352b;"You're as bad as the demons
in Solomon Shrine!";"";"";
73561;"My bones! My brittle bones!";"";"";
73583;"A present for me?
Oh, my! Aren't you
just precious!";"";"";
735bd;"...Though if it's a discount you're
after, I'm afraid the answer is no.
Business is business, after all!";"";"";
7362d;"Bring me more, and I'll give
you a little something of my
own in return!";"";"";
7367d;"I certainly couldn't refuse
a gift from a handsome younger
man, now, could I?";"";"";
736d1;"A present for me?
Oh, my! Aren't you
just precious!";"";"";
7370b;"But, disappoint I shall!";"";"";
7372b;"If that's what you had in mind...
well, then I'm sorry to disappoint.";"";"";
73777;"Still, no matter how many gifts
you give me, I have no intention
of offering you a discount.";"";"";
737db;"A gift, for me? Thank you.";"";"";
737fd;"The will to give to others is even
more endearing than the gift itself.
So thank you again, young man!";"";"";
7386b;"You're never too old to enjoy getting
presents...though I'm not all that old
to begin with, of course!";"";"";
738d9;"For me, again? Thank you.";"";"";
738f9;"If you keep this up, your real
girlfriend is going to think
she's not special to you...";"";"";
73957;"Ha! That's it, isn't it? You're a real
player, Adol Christin! And you're not
doing yourself any favors, either.";"";"";
739cd;"...Or do you just indiscriminately
give gifts to everyone you meet?";"";"";
73a17;"This is getting to be a bit of a
habit. Do you have a thing for
older women or something?";"";"";
73a77;"You're giving me a gift?
Thank you very much.";"";"";
73aab;"I made it myself. Doesn't it look
scrumptious? I'm well-known around
here for baking great pies.";"";"";
73b13;"Here, why don't you take this?
It's a Cruberry Pie.";"";"";
73b4d;"Are you just using me for practice?
Heh, well, you're good! And I do
honestly appreciate all the gifts.";"";"";
73bbb;"Ha! I gather by that look that
I'm right on the mark.";"";"";
73bf7;"...Or, these gifts are being given
to me by proxy, and you actually
have someone ELSE in your thoughts.";"";"";
73c65;"I'm getting the impression that
either you prefer older women...";"";"";
73cad;"...Oh, wait, you haven't eaten the
pie I gave you before? You should eat
that one before I give you another!";"";"";
73d21;"You're a handsome man, so you should
have no trouble sweeping that girl of
yours off her feet. Now go on, eat!";"";"";
73d97;"I don't need your pity!";"";"";
73db5;"A gift for me? ...Whatever.";"";"";
73dd7;"But if you do it again, then I'm taking
all my best merchandise OFF the shelves
whenever you walk through that door!";"";"";
73e53;"I was going to double all my prices for
you, as revenge for the BURNING you gave
me...but I guess we'll call it even.";"";"";
73ecf;"You're giving me a gift?
#w30#...Waitwaitwait, hold up
just a second...";"";"";
73f1d;"RE-GIFTER!";"";"";
73f2f;"This was from me to you!
Re-gifting it back to me
is extremely rude!";"";"";
73f7b;"Ack! Are you trying
to say I'm fired?!";"";"";
73fa9;"For me? My, how kind!";"";"";
73fc5;"For me? You really
shouldn't have!";"";"";
73fef;"You're giving this to me?
What a kind fellow you are!
Thank you very much!";"";"";
74041;"You know, I'm still pretty badly
burned from that fireball you
threw. You think this is a game?!";"";"";
740a9;"I don't mean to be so judgmental,
but that fire magic really hurts!";"";"";
740f3;"Nothing else holds a candle
to the pain I feel right now!";"";"";
74133;"Oh, are you giving this to me?
Well then, let me give you
a word of advice in return.";"";"";
7418f;"Makes you wonder, where the
heck did those demons actually
come from...?";"";"";
741df;"Some demons are actually smarter
than we are! So you'd do well not
to underestimate them.";"";"";
7423f;"I used to think of the demons as nothing
more than dumb brutes...but that changed
after I was captured by them.";"";"";
742b5;"Oh, are you giving this to me?
Well then, let me give you
a word of advice in return.";"";"";
74311;"Your survival will always depend
on knowing how best to apply your
strength in any given situation.";"";"";
7437b;"Some demons are immune to physical
attacks, while others can shrug off
magic like it's nothing.";"";"";
743e1;"Oh, are you giving this to me?
Well then, let me give you
a word of advice in return.";"";"";
7443d;"I recommend carrying with you a means of
restoring your spent power since you may
be far from a village when it happens.";"";"";
744bd;"He who uses it cannot STOP using it
until all his force of will has been
thoroughly used up. Or so they say.";"";"";
74531;"The magic of the Priest who governed
'Spirit'...holds a power not so much
sacred as it is...something else.";"";"";
745a3;"Those fireballs really hurt,
you know!";"";"";
745d1;"What the hell were you thinking?!";"";"";
745f9;"...You know, burns never
really heal properly.";"";"";
7462f;"And you think a little gift is
going to make it all better?!
...Well, it's a start, I guess.";"";"";
74693;"I'm still in AGONIZING PAIN
thanks to you.";"";"";
746c5;"Yeeeeow! Some like it
hot, but I do NOT!";"";"";
746f5;"I can have this? Thank you. May
the blessings of the Goddesses be
with you on your journey.";"";"";
74757;"Maybe it's just name association,
but I swear that demon's actually
kind of...nice!";"";"";
747b1;"By the way, do you know that green demon
named Keith? There was once a boy here
in the village who had that same name...";"";"";
74831;"I can have this? Thank you. May
the blessings of the Goddesses be
with you on your journey.";"";"";
74893;"*sigh* It's like those peaceful
days were just...a wonderful dream.
They feel so far away now...";"";"";
748fb;"Theirs was that house in the western
part of the village. If not for that
tragedy six months ago...";"";"";
74965;"So if you were curious to learn more
about that Keith fellow, he actually
lived here with his sister, Marle.";"";"";
749d9;"This is for me? My, you're so
very kind and thoughtful!";"";"";
74a17;"I believe that brother and sister-- you
know, Keith and Marle-- were descended
from one of the six Priests of Ys.";"";"";
74a8f;"I have no new information for you
today...not factual information,
anyway. But I have a theory!";"";"";
74af5;"I sense that you are rich with
the blessings of the Goddesses.";"";"";
74b3b;"...Between getting captured by demons
and having my savior PELT ME WITH FIRE,
it's a wonder I'm still alive at all!";"";"";
74bb5;"Thank you. I'll accept
this as your apology.";"";"";
74be9;"I hope the Goddesses are as
willing to forgive you your
transgressions.";"";"";
74c37;"Yipes! Why would you DO that?!";"";"";
74c5d;"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";"";"";
74ca7;"And if you think I'm lying,
try giving me something else.
See what happens.";"";"";
74cf9;"Just so you know, though...even
when I receive gifts, I really
can't give anything in return.";"";"";
74d5d;"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";"";"";
74da7;"Not me, though! Heh.";"";"";
74dc3;"And just so you know...sometimes, when
you give gifts to people, they'll give
you things in return.";"";"";
74e2d;"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";"";"";
74e77;"Not me, though! Heh.";"";"";
74e93;"And just so you know...sometimes, when
you give gifts to people, they'll give
you things in return.";"";"";
74efd;"Hahaha. It's so wonderful of you
to give gifts to someone like me.";"";"";
74f47;"Not me, though! Heh.";"";"";
74f63;"And just so you know...sometimes, when
you give gifts to people, they'll give
you things in return.";"";"";
74fcd;"Hahaha. No ordinary man would come all
this way just to give me a gift. Is
there something I should know about you?";"";"";
75047;"I guess that DOES beg the question as
to how I know so much about gift-giving.
But I don't plan on telling you. Hahaha.";"";"";
750c5;"Generally, it's a ratio of two people
per village. And all you can really do
is guess which ones. So...give freely!";"";"";
7513f;"Remember, I said people SOMETIMES give
you things in return for gifts. The key
word there is sometimes. It's not often!";"";"";
751bd;"I guess you're hoping I have some hidden
stash of treasure, or rare information.
But I really don't!";"";"";
75229;"(Owww. These burns really hurt.)
...#w10#Hmm? You're giving this to me?";"";"";
75277;"What's this? Suddenly, the pain of my
burns is beginning to fade. Yes, my
burns are literally healing themselves!";"";"";
752ef;"Hahaha. It's wonderful of you
to bring me a gift.";"";"";
75327;"Hahaha. Try to be more careful
from now on, okay?";"";"";
7535f;"Hahaha. That really hurt.";"";"";
7537f;"Ah, thank you. Please let
me know if I can assist you
on your quest in any way.";"";"";
753d5;"Is that for me? I feel kind
of guilty accepting another
gift from you...";"";"";
75425;"If there's anything I can do to help,
don't hesitate to ask. I can lend you
anything, aside from money.";"";"";
75493;"Is that for me?";"";"";
754a9;"...Well, I can't offer much in the way
of money or wisdom. But anything else,
man, and I've got you covered!";"";"";
7551d;"Thank you. I promised I'd help you in
my dream, and you keep on making that
promise easier and easier to keep.";"";"";
75593;"Is that for me?";"";"";
755a9;"...Well, any way other than money,
wisdom, or strength. I'm pretty well
lacking in those three fields.";"";"";
75617;"Thank you. I'll help out in any way I
possibly can, so feel free to ask away.";"";"";
7566b;"Is that for me?";"";"";
75681;"So yeah...anything at all!
Just ask!";"";"";
756ad;"I'm also not someone you'd want to ask
for love advice. Aside from that,
though, I'm your man!";"";"";
75713;"...Well, any way other than money,
wisdom, or strength. I'm pretty well
lacking in those three fields.";"";"";
75781;"Thank you. I'll help out in any way I
possibly can, so feel free to ask away.";"";"";
757d5;"Adol...";"";"";
757e3;"Don't you have something to
say for yourself? Speak with
words, not with gifts!";"";"";
75839;"...In my mind, I'm still putting
out all the fires you caused.";"";"";
7587f;"Please be careful using your
magic around here. Seriously.";"";"";
758c1;"Fire! Fiiiiire!";"";"";
758d7;"This is for me? Why, thank you!
As payment, how about I give you
some potentially useful information?";"";"";
75943;"...Oh, you actually want information?
Crap. I was expecting you to say no.
I don't actually have anything to say!";"";"";
759bb;"This is for me? Why, thank you!
As payment, how about I give you
some potentially useful information?";"";"";
75a27;"Your gift-giving shall remain
unrequited, I'm afraid-- no
matter how generous you may be.";"";"";
75a87;"...Like before, though, I don't really
HAVE any useful information for you.
I'm boring like that!";"";"";
75aef;"This is for me? Why, thank you!
As payment, how about I give you
some potentially useful information?";"";"";
75b5b;"Strange people tend to know
strange things. And I'm not
really all that strange!";"";"";
75bb3;"...Come, now, did you really think I
actually had anything for you? You're
far too gullible!";"";"";
75c17;"Don't go thinking a present is
going to get you off the hook.";"";"";
75c5b;"What was with your little fireball
spree? Was it an 'absolute power
corrupts absolutely' thing?";"";"";
75cc1;"I guess I'll accept this as an apology.
But don't expect a thank you.";"";"";
75d0d;"Owwie owwie owwie!
That smarts!";"";"";
75d33;"Oh, thank you very much.";"";"";
75d53;"I shall graciously accept!";"";"";
75d75;"My thanks to you once again.";"";"";
75d99;"I shall graaaaaaciously accept!";"";"";
75dbf;"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!";"";"";
75deb;"I shall graaaaaaaaaaaaaciously accept!";"";"";
75e19;"Thank you for your contribution to
the 'Cure Jill's Burns Fund.'";"";"";
75e61;"...I take it this is your apology?";"";"";
75e8b;"Well, now, thank you.";"";"";
75ea7;"...I take it this is your apology?";"";"";
75ed1;"Eeeek! Help! Spike!";"";"";
75eeb;"Oh my, is this for me? Well,
then, let me return the favor
with some travel advice.";"";"";
75f45;"Hadat might be a better choice. He's
not quite up to par with Regg, but
he's a lot less touched in the head.";"";"";
75fb9;"I don't know if he should be your first
choice for support, though. He's kind of
kooky or quiet, depending on his mood.";"";"";
76037;"Old man Regg is probably the smartest
person in the village. He knows all
manner of obscure and esoteric stuff.";"";"";
760ad;"Oh, this is for me?
Why, thank you very much!";"";"";
760e1;"And if that happens, I'll happily
introduce you to my daughter!";"";"";
76127;"If you remain this kind as you
mature, you'll grow up to be a
truly marvelous man.";"";"";
76181;"Oh, my... For me?
Thank you so much!";"";"";
761ad;"At this rate, you'd make a fine
son-in-law when you get older...";"";"";
761f5;"If you keep giving me gifts, I'll
run out of dialogue options!";"";"";
7623b;"Oh, is that for me?";"";"";
76255;"Take your time. Play it slow,
and get to know her first.
You'll be much happier that way!";"";"";
762b5;"You shouldn't rush in to a
relationship, you know.";"";"";
762ef;"Could it be that you intend all these
gifts as dowry for my daughter?";"";"";
7633b;"I hate lawless tramps who call
themselves swordsmen. And I CERTAINLY
wouldn't let them marry my daughter!";"";"";
763ab;"Are you a traveler?";"";"";
763c5;"It ain't proper 'round these parts,
though. So no more firey shooty, okay?";"";"";
76417;"I guess I can forgive you, what with all
your generosity. After all, maybe where
you're from, a fireball is like 'hello'!";"";"";
76497;"AIUEO!";"";"";
764a5;"What? For me?!";"";"";
764bb;"So I guess I'll just leave you with
this: If there's ever anything I can
do to help, please let me know.";"";"";
7652b;"This cheers me up a little.
I don't have anything on hand
to give in return, though...";"";"";
76589;"Thank you kindly!
Lately, I've been
awfully depressed.";"";"";
765c7;"Thank you very much.
Umm...";"";"";
765e9;"I don't have anything to give you in
return, but I hope you'll come see me
again. I enjoy talking with you.";"";"";
7665b;"Thank you very much.";"";"";
76677;"Don't know much else about it...
but if a priest owned it, does
that mean it's been blessed?";"";"";
766db;"Supposedly, my friend Maria's bracelet
that she always wears once belonged to
a priest of some sort. Weird, huh?";"";"";
76753;"This may not be the ideal way to say
thank you, but I do have some juicy
gossip you might find interesting.";"";"";
767c5;"Umm... That really hurt, you
know. Your magic, I mean.";"";"";
76803;"Thank you. This should help
soothe the burns you inflicted
upon me.";"";"";
7684d;"Aieeee?!";"";"";
7685d;"That's for me?
How very kind!";"";"";
76881;"If you don't mind hearing me
prattle on, I'd be grateful
for your company anytime.";"";"";
768db;"That's for me? How very kind! If you
don't mind hearing me prattle on, I'd
be grateful for your company anytime.";"";"";
76953;"You should see if you can find it.
I'll bet you can!";"";"";
7698f;"Supposedly, he hid a precious artifact
in a chamber there, but it's blocked by
a barrier that only his magic can break.";"";"";
76a0d;"Today's prattle: One of the six Priests
of Ys governed the power of 'Light.' He
lived in the west section of the Shrine.";"";"";
76a8d;"Hmm. All right.";"";"";
76aa3;"I can see you're trying to make
amends, so I'll take it. Thanks!";"";"";
76aeb;"Hmm. All right.";"";"";
76b01;"I'll try to forget about
the...unpleasantness...
earlier.";"";"";
76b41;"What the...?!";"";"";
76b55;"Oh, hey, thanks. Don't have anything
to give you in return, but here's a
little word of advice for ya'.";"";"";
76bc3;"...But you certainly don't HAVE to.
People will remember you fondly even
if you're totally selfish!";"";"";
76c2d;"It's all well and good to go around
giving gifts to everyone, if you have
the time and money to waste...";"";"";
76c9d;"Most people will like you
just fine, even if you don't
give them a damned thing.";"";"";
76cf5;"Oh, hey, thanks. Don't have anything
to give you in return, but here's a
little word of advice for ya'.";"";"";
76d63;"...Though if you DO bring me a gift,
I'll happily accept it, of course!";"";"";
76db1;"Not much else I can tell you, so you
know what? You shouldn't bring ME any
more gifts, either! There's no point!";"";"";
76e29;"...Are you taking the time to pick out
unique gifts for each person? Well...
Don't bother! Generic is just as good!";"";"";
76ea3;"What the hell are you doing
blasting people with fireballs?!
It's not right!";"";"";
76ef7;"Hehh?";"";"";
76f03;"I'll forgive you this time,
but DON'T do it again, okay?";"";"";
76f43;"That is all.";"";"";
76f57;"FIREBALLS HURT.";"";"";
76f6d;"Oh, hey, thanks. Don't have anything
to give you in return, but here's a
little word of advice for ya'.";"";"";
76fdb;"Oh, that's it. You're
going on 'the list'!";"";"";
7700d;"This is for me, is it?
Oh, my. Whatever shall I do?";"";"";
77047;"I can sense that you're a
warm and sympathetic soul.";"";"";
77083;"This is for me, is it?
Really, whatever shall I do?";"";"";
770bd;"I'm afraid I don't have anything
to give you in return. But thank
you very much!";"";"";
77115;"You're giving this to me?
My, you're such a faithful
little guy, like a doggie!";"";"";
7716b;"I mean, do you actually think an older
lady like me would have anything worth
your while?";"";"";
771cb;"You might want to give gifts to the
younger crowd, though. They're much more
likely to return the favor.";"";"";
7723b;"I just never get tired of
receiving gifts from men,
no matter how often it happens!";"";"";
77295;"How can you be so mean as to
attack an innocent woman with
fireballs?!";"";"";
772e3;"Well, I guess we can forget about
the little fireball incident.";"";"";
77329;"But all the pretty girls will
hate you if you keep that up,
you know!";"";"";
77375;"Kids these days...";"";"";
7738f;"...";"";"";
77399;"...Thank you.";"";"";
773ad;"That's very kind of you.";"";"";
773cd;"You're really
nice, mister.";"";"";
773ef;"...Hey!
...Go away.";"";"";
77409;"...I hate you.";"";"";
7741f;"Noooooo! Stop!";"";"";
77435;"Thank you. You're
a strong man.";"";"";
7745b;"Rather, you must have a very strong
sense of morals, to think of others
at a time like this.";"";"";
774bf;"...By which I DON'T mean physical
strength or raw skill...";"";"";
77501;"You shouldn't have...but you
did, so thank you.";"";"";
77537;"Watching you and seeing all you do
makes me feel...that you deserve more
help than you're getting, I guess.";"";"";
775a9;"Lately, I've gotten to thinking
that we should all be doing more
than we are.";"";"";
775fd;"Thank you, Adol. If something were to
happen...if we were to lose you...I feel
like a normal grave wouldn't be enough.";"";"";
7767b;"And even if you died tomorrow, I'd
never forget you. Never! You're
unforgettable, in every way.";"";"";
776e1;"Not that that's going to happen anytime
soon, of course. You seem like you're
the type to live forever.";"";"";
7774f;"Thank you. Would you be offended
if I were to leave some of your
gifts at the graves here?";"";"";
777b1;"Of course, I'm only talking about
non-food items. I plan to eat any
food you give me myself!";"";"";
77815;"I just want you to know
that they're being put
to good use...";"";"";
77859;"Thank you so much.";"";"";
77873;"That's why I dig graves. Because I CAN.
It's what I'm good at. And we all have
our own parts to play in this life.";"";"";
778ed;"Those of us left behind have to
carry on, and honor those who moved
on to better places.";"";"";
7794d;"There's more to life than digging
graves and mourning the dead.";"";"";
77993;"Every time I see you, Adol,
it reminds me that there's
still hope for the world.";"";"";
779eb;"You're the one who attacked me
with magic, aren't you?";"";"";
77a29;"Aren't there enough graves
here already?!";"";"";
77a59;"You're the one who attacked me
with magic, aren't you?";"";"";
77a97;"If you hadn't let up, I'd have
needed a grave of my own!";"";"";
77ad7;"Ashes to ashes...";"";"";
77aef;"Heh heheh.
Thanks.";"";"";
77b09;"I could come with you
and back you up!";"";"";
77b37;"But you know what'd be even better
than gifts? You could show me how
to fight an' use magic!";"";"";
77b9b;"Heh heheh.
Thanks.";"";"";
77bb5;"Her Cruberry Pie
is the best!";"";"";
77bd9;"You know Miss Zalem over at the armory?
You wouldn't know it by looking at her,
but she's actually a REALLY good chef.";"";"";
77c57;"Here, I'll let you in
on a little secret...";"";"";
77c89;"Eheh heh. Thanks.";"";"";
77ca1;"...is what old man Regg said.";"";"";
77cc5;"You should remember that if
you're ever lost in the Shrine!";"";"";
77d07;"Solomon Shrine is divided up into
a bunch of sections, each under the
control of one of the Priests.";"";"";
77d73;"Psst, listen to this!";"";"";
77d8f;"Mister... That really hurt!";"";"";
77db1;"I know I said I wanted you to teach me
magic, but I didn't mean for you to
do target practice on me!";"";"";
77e1d;"Faiyaaaaaa!";"";"";
77e2f;"Thanks, mister.";"";"";
77e45;"This really makes me happy.";"";"";
77e67;"Thanks, mister.";"";"";
77e7d;"Almost as much as my daddy!";"";"";
77e9f;"I love you, mister.";"";"";
77eb9;"Thanks, mister.";"";"";
77ecf;"We shouldn't tell Daddy
yet, though.";"";"";
77efb;"When I grow up, I'm
gonna marry you, okay?";"";"";
77f2d;"Thanks, mister.";"";"";
77f43;"It's really pretty...
You're gonna love it!";"";"";
77f75;"This time, I'm gonna show you my
favorite things in the world.";"";"";
77fbb;"Thanks, mister.";"";"";
77fd1;"Look, isn't it pretty?
I've got lots, so here,
I'll give you this one.";"";"";
7801f;"Heh heh. Now let me show you
this treasure I got!";"";"";
78057;"...That really hurt!";"";"";
78073;"...That hurt a lot.
You're a meanie!";"";"";
7809f;"Enjoy it!";"";"";
780af;"Eat it like a big boy, and
I'll give you another!";"";"";
780e7;"Wait... You already have a Cruberry.
You should eat that one before I give
you another!";"";"";
78145;"Eeeeeeeek!";"";"";
78157;"For me? Yaaay, thanks!
I got a gift! ♪";"";"";
78185;"Woooo! I got a present!
I got a preeeeseeeent!";"";"";
781bb;"Thanks, mister!";"";"";
781d1;"I feel bad taking all these things
from you, though. So how about I
tell you something cool, as a trade?";"";"";
78241;"Okay, listen closely... This
is seeeecret information, so
use it wisely, got it?";"";"";
78299;"I bet with some mining equipment,
though, you could knock down that
cracked wall, no problem!";"";"";
782fd;"There's a place in the ruins with a
treasure chest, but it's all sealed up.
You can only see it through some cracks.";"";"";
78379;"Thanks, mister!";"";"";
7838f;"...Not interested? You have someone
else in mind? Okay, I guess... I still
feel weird about it, but thank you!";"";"";
78405;"I want to do something nice for you in
return for all these gifts, though.
Maybe I can introduce you to Miss Esca!";"";"";
7847f;"...I'll take it. Thank you.
But don't think this makes
up for attacking me!";"";"";
784d1;"...Just don't attack me again...
and...I guess all is forgiven.";"";"";
78517;"Man, this is my favorite shirt!
You're MEAN!";"";"";
7854b;"If you keep giving me food, I'm gonna
get FAT! You should feed the birds--
get THEM fat, so we can eat 'em later!";"";"";
785c3;"Aww, yeah! Aww, YEAH!
I got a present! I got a preeseent!
From a BOY! This is sooo cool!";"";"";
78623;"Aww, yeah! Aww, YEAH!
I got a present! I got a preeseent!
From a BOY! This is sooo cool!";"";"";
78683;"That's plenty, mister! You've
already made me super-happy!
I don't need anything else!";"";"";
786e1;"Aww, yeah! Aww, YEAH!
I got a present! I got a preeseent!
From a BOY! This is sooo cool!";"";"";
78741;"Thank you, mister!
Thankyouthankyouthankyou!";"";"";
78775;"Awesome. You gave me a present,
an' that makes you awesome!";"";"";
787b7;"Thank you, mister!
Thankyouthankyouthankyou!";"";"";
787eb;"Awesome. You gave me a present,
an' that makes you awesome!";"";"";
7882d;"When I grow up, maybe you
can be my boyfriend!";"";"";
78863;"Thank you, mister! And not just
a regular thank you, but a SUPER
ULTRA DELUXE thank you!";"";"";
788c3;"I hate you, mister!";"";"";
788dd;"Phooey! Get it away from me!";"";"";
78901;"Ouch, that's hot!
You suck, mister!";"";"";
7892b;"Oh, thank you. I'd like to give
you some information in return,
but there's not much I can say...";"";"";
78993;"All I've got are some words of advice:
If you should ever learn magic, don't
use it on townsfolk. We get mad.";"";"";
78a07;"Oh, thank you. I'd like to give
you some information in return,
but there's not much I can say...";"";"";
78a6f;"How about a few words of advice? Always
keep your adventure log up-to-date. It
doesn't take THAT much time, you know?";"";"";
78aeb;"Oh, thank you. I'd like to give you some
information in return, but my knowledge
has been just about sucked dry.";"";"";
78b63;"About all that's left is to suggest you
always keep a Wing on hand just in case.
You never know when you may need it!";"";"";
78bdf;"Wow, you're just a fountain of gifts!
Alright, I guess I've got one more piece
of advice up my sleeve. But only one!";"";"";
78c5b;"Be sure to take note of this, lest your
MP drain away to nothing and leave you
stranded in hostile lands.";"";"";
78ccb;"Some magic wands grant passive abilities
that drain your magic points just by
having them equipped.";"";"";
78d35;"Ahem. While I appreciate the gesture,
you attacked me with fire magic earlier.
And that really, really hurt.";"";"";
78da9;"All right, fine...I have some advice for
you, in exchange for your 'kind' gift.
Consider it...a warning.";"";"";
78e19;"We may not be main characters, but we
have feelings, dammit. So STOP TRYING TO
BURN US, YOU PYROMANIACAL JACKASS.";"";"";
78e91;"What?! Who?! Huh?!";"";"";
78eab;"Buyin' some gossip, eh? Well, you know
Roos, those cute little critters? Turns
out they live in cute little TOWNS!";"";"";
78f25;"Gossip your game, is it? Well, you sure
know how to light my Masontorch! You
hear what the demons have been doing?";"";"";
78f9f;"They've been kidnapping people, out of
the blue! Supposedly to be used for some
sort of sacrificial ceremony. Scary!";"";"";
7901b;"Why, thank you muchly, good sir! You're
so very generous. Or are you just very
curious, perhaps?";"";"";
79083;"Maybe that's where the demons live!";"";"";
790ad;"My sources tell me the kidnap victims
have all been taken to the Shrine of
Solomon, high atop the mountains.";"";"";
79121;"Oh, NOW you're being nice to me!
Are you a servant for the demons
or something?!";"";"";
79179;"...I suppose I can accept this
gift as your apology. Just don't
let it happen again!";"";"";
791d5;"Maybe I should spread some
nasty rumors about you...
See how YOU like it!";"";"";
79225;"Well, now, this is a surprise,
after all those rumors about you
being evil incarnate. Heh heh heh.";"";"";
7928f;"But I'll let it slide...
just this once.";"";"";
792bf;"Good thing I held off on spreading
that around the village, or you'd
have an angry mob after you!";"";"";
79327;"Ow! Stop it! Despite my name,
I AM NOT A TORCH!";"";"";
7935d;"This is for me? I...I don't know
what to say. Thank you!";"";"";
7939d;"Just so you know, while I DO appreciate
your generosity, I have no intention of
giving you anything in return.";"";"";
79413;"It's a personal policy. I hate social
obligations like that. Sorry! I hope
you don't think any less of me.";"";"";
79485;"I'll accept your gift, but I'm afraid I
won't be giving you anything in return.
I'm sorry. I hope you're not mad!";"";"";
794fd;"No matter how much you give me, you're
not getting anything in return. I'm not
like other NPCs that way, I swear!";"";"";
79575;"You might as well stop giving me gifts.
It's not like I'm concealing some sort
of secret or anything...";"";"";
795e3;"*sigh* Okay, you win. I'll let you
in on a well-kept secret. A REAL one,
too-- not one of those obvious ones!";"";"";
79657;"Apparently, they've even been
eating gold coins lately!";"";"";
79695;"They tend to eat anything
that'll fit in their mouths.";"";"";
796d3;"You've seen the ducklings
that wander around Lance
Village, right?";"";"";
7971d;"In fact, I believe one of them just ate
500 Gold this very minute! Why not try
bothering a duck? You might get rich!";"";"";
79799;"After what you did to me?
Yeah... More, please!";"";"";
797cf;"Is this an apology? Well...fine,
then. I guess I'll forgive you.";"";"";
79817;"Help! Help! My ass is aflame!";"";"";
7983b;"Oh, is this for me?";"";"";
79855;"Thank you. You're too kind!";"";"";
79877;"For me? Again?! I...feel kind
of bad for accepting so many
gifts from you, to be honest!";"";"";
798d7;"Full of treasure, they are! Riches that
are just sitting there, in out-of-the-
way locations. So explore thoroughly!";"";"";
79953;"I guess I can give you some good info,
at the very least. You know Moondoria,
and the Rasteenie Mine?";"";"";
799bf;"You got a thing for me? Haha! No, I'm
just kidding. I know you simply wish to
express your admiration of me!";"";"";
79a33;"Have you found that one? If not...
you should look for it. Trust me,
it'll be fun! You'll be glad you did!";"";"";
79aa5;"Apparently, amongst all the treasure
boxes, there's one that's...just a box.
No treasure.";"";"";
79b05;"So, yeah, I'll let you in on a little
secret. The deepest caverns of Rasteenie
Mine are full to the brim with treasure.";"";"";
79b83;"Mood swing much?!";"";"";
79b9b;"I'm all for practical jokes, but FIRE-
BALLS AREN'T FUNNY. And offering me a
gift, while kind, will do you no favors!";"";"";
79c17;"You can gift me up 'til there are no
gifts left to give, but it still won't
make up for SETTING ME ON FIRE.";"";"";
79c89;"...Seriously, what the hell
were you thinking?!";"";"";
79cbf;"Yeeeeeeeooowwch!";"";"";
79cd7;"A gift? For me? Oh, what
a kind young gentleman!";"";"";
79d0f;"Oh, another for me?
Thank you so much!";"";"";
79d3d;"Oh, dear... You've gone
from generous to creepy.
But in a good way!";"";"";
79d87;"Oh, my dear...";"";"";
79d9d;"Are you, perhaps...?";"";"";
79db9;"Ooh-hoo-hoo! I'm flattered, really I am.
But I'm afraid I'm already married...
I'm so sorry!";"";"";
79e1d;"Stay away! Don't get near me
anymore, you creep!";"";"";
79e55;"...So you'll stop with the
fireballs, then?";"";"";
79e87;"Ouch! Oh, dear...";"";"";
79e9f;"So this is...for me?
Wow. Thanks!";"";"";
79ec7;"Oh... Is this a token of
your feelings? Thank you!";"";"";
79f01;"Are you interested in me? You've been
admiring me from afar because of my
radiant beauty? Thank you so, so much!";"";"";
79f79;"So...you like me, right? Because I'm
the prettiest girl you ever did see?
You're so very kind to imply so!";"";"";
79feb;"So, you want to be with me? There's no
one else in the world who could bring
you joy? Stop, you're making me blush!";"";"";
7a065;"That was pretty HOT back there. Were
you trying to show me the HEAT of your
PASSION? Yeah, THAT'S what I THOUGHT!";"";"";
7a0dd;"...Are you nervous and shy? Is that why
you burned me? Was it a hesitant burn?
A love fizzle, if you will?";"";"";
7a14f;"Ooh, it burns so gooood...";"";"";
7a171;"Ah, thank you. You're a pretty
level-headed lad, you are. Well,
do take care!";"";"";
7a1c5;"Such a kind boy. I will keep
you in my thoughts and
prayers.";"";"";
7a209;"I'm touched that you would
show such thoughtfulness to
an old man like me.";"";"";
7a25b;"As they say, what goes around comes
around. Your kindness will surely net
you great rewards in the future.";"";"";
7a2cd;"...And not just from me.";"";"";
7a2ed;"...";"";"";
7a2f7;"You're evil, you know that?
Evil incarnate! That's what
I've been telling people.";"";"";
7a34f;"Kids these days, with their
fire and their swords...";"";"";
7a38b;"You're giving this to me?
Well, thank you very much!";"";"";
7a3c7;"If only I were a little younger,
you might just have me swooning
for you, my friend!";"";"";
7a423;"It's always nice to receive gifts,
no matter how old you are.";"";"";
7a467;"Oh, thank you... But what fun is
there in giving presents to an
old woman like me?";"";"";
7a4c1;"Not that I'm complaining!";"";"";
7a4e1;"Imagine, gifts for an old lady...
you haven't taken a fancy to me,
have you?";"";"";
7a535;"Old ladies and fire do not mix.
And gifts do not make up for
burns. Especially at my age!";"";"";
7a595;"Be more careful next time, lad.";"";"";
7a5bb;"Ouch! What do you do?";"";"";
7a5d7;"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";"";"";
7a629;"...But never mind him. This is the old
woman's story! And she lived happily
ever after. The End. ...Not bad, eh?";"";"";
7a6a1;"One day, a boy fell from the
sky, his body engulfed in
light.";"";"";
7a6e5;"Once upon a time, there
lived an old man and an
old woman.";"";"";
7a727;"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";"";"";
7a779;"...But the old woman knew nothing of
this, nor did she care. She was too
busy living happily ever after! The End.";"";"";
7a7f1;"One day, a young man came down
the river, riding a small boat.";"";"";
7a837;"Once upon a time, there
lived an old man and an
old woman.";"";"";
7a879;"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";"";"";
7a8cb;"...You'd think that'd fascinate the old
woman, but nope. She just kept on living
happily ever after. The End!";"";"";
7a93f;"One day, a boy sprang up from
the ground, mounted atop a
giant mole.";"";"";
7a98b;"Once upon a time, there
lived an old man and an
old woman.";"";"";
7a9cd;"Ah, you're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";"";"";
7aa1f;"...What do you think? I love happy
stories. Especially when it seems
like there might be a sequel!";"";"";
7aa89;"He showered the old woman
with gifts, and made her
very, very happy. The End.";"";"";
7aadd;"One day, a handsome young
man with red hair came into
her life.";"";"";
7ab23;"Once upon a time, there was an
old woman living all by herself.";"";"";
7ab69;"You've got a lot to learn, if you
think this is going to make up
for tossing fire at an old woman.";"";"";
7abd3;"...Even though it has.
This time.";"";"";
7abfb;"...You're most gracious.
Please, allow me to tell
you a story, as thanks.";"";"";
7ac4b;"The moral of the story is, think about
the consequences of your actions. Also,
trust is earned. Do you understand?";"";"";
7acc5;"The old woman suggested he rethink
the purpose of the magical power that
had been passed on to him.";"";"";
7ad2f;"He threw fireballs at the old woman,
and caused her great pain. She was in
danger of NOT living happily ever after!";"";"";
7ada9;"One day, a young traveling
swordsman appeared.";"";"";
7addf;"Once upon a time, there was
an old woman living all by
herself.";"";"";
7ae25;"Yaaaouch! Seafood soup!";"";"";
7ae43;"Oh, my... At times like these,
a simple act of kindness can
mean so much. Thank you.";"";"";
7ae9f;"Oh, thank you. Not only are you
a seemingly very skilled swordsman,
but you're also a kind man!";"";"";
7af05;"There must be a reason you've
been brought to this accursed
land of demons...";"";"";
7af59;"You have a very unique air about
you. Did you come looking for some
sort of grand adventure?";"";"";
7afbd;"Th-thanks... You know, I feel guilty
accepting all these gifts from you.
How about I give you some advice?";"";"";
7b02f;"Just remember that with every door that
closes, another opens. Even the worst
ending can lead to a great beginning!";"";"";
7b0a9;"Hardship builds character and gives you
the experience needed to persevere. In
the end, you'll always come out ahead!";"";"";
7b125;"Such a generous individual! Let me give
you some valuable advice...though I have
a feeling you might already know it.";"";"";
7b1a1;"If you want good tidings to come your
way, definitely keep your eyes open.
Iron is a hot commodity around here.";"";"";
7b217;"Even if you find just a little piece,
that could be representative of a new
vein yet to be discovered.";"";"";
7b285;"You haven't happened across any
Iron Ore in the abandoned Rasteenie
Mine, have you?";"";"";
7b2df;"It's nice of you to give me this,
but please, stop throwing fireballs!
You'll put someone's eye out!";"";"";
7b34b;"Since you're the one tossing them, I
imagine you've never been hit by one,
but let me tell you...it hurts! A lot!";"";"";
7b3c3;"I do appreciate the gesture, but please,
stop throwing fireballs, okay? You're
liable to kill someone!";"";"";
7b431;"...I'll let it slide this time.
Just don't do it again!";"";"";
7b46f;"Hothothothothothothot!";"";"";
7b48d;"Ah, how kind! Please
accept my gratitude.";"";"";
7b4bd;"Give readily, and you
will gain heartily.";"";"";
7b4ed;"Speaking as the village elder, I would
be overjoyed if you'd keep this in mind
during your interactions with my people.";"";"";
7b56b;"But people love gifts. And oftentimes,
the shyest person will open up like a
book when you get a good gift in them.";"";"";
7b5e5;"Most people are basically
selfish, when you get right
down to it.";"";"";
7b62d;"Oh, my, thank you. But please, stop
making such a fuss over me! Others
deserve such things more than I.";"";"";
7b69b;"Whether for good or ill,
I cannot say. I believe
that...is up to you.";"";"";
7b6e7;"I'm fascinated by them as well. Those
two girls appearing in the ruins are an
omen...a harbinger of change.";"";"";
7b759;"Leggs, for example. He could use a nice
gift to get his mind off the Goddesses.
Not that I don't share his obsession...";"";"";
7b7d7;"For me? You are far too kind!";"";"";
7b7fb;"Perhaps your arrival is
also a portent of the
changes yet to come.";"";"";
7b845;"With demons all over the place, and
those two girls I saw at the ruins...
I just don't know what's what anymore!";"";"";
7b8bd;"Lance Village may not be the
only place that's affected. It
could be the whole land of Ys.";"";"";
7b91f;"In the days since you've arrived
here, strange occurrences have
been afoot.";"";"";
7b971;"For me? Oh, thank you
so much!";"";"";
7b997;"Perhaps my prayers were answered.
I prayed that the Goddesses would
come to us in our time of need.";"";"";
7ba01;"I have to wonder if the two girls
I saw in Moondoria were just an
illusion...or my imagination.";"";"";
7ba67;"Young swordsman...";"";"";
7ba81;"If you keep setting my people on
fire, I'm afraid I'll have to ban
you from the village. You got it?";"";"";
7baed;"*sigh* Another gift? All right.
Thank you. I suppose I can overlook
the fireball incident.";"";"";
7bb4f;"But all use of attack magic within
the village is hereby prohibited.
Understood?";"";"";
7bba7;"Et tu, Adol?!";"";"";
7bbbb;"For me? Oh, my! You
shouldn't have!";"";"";
7bbe5;"Oh, is this for me? You're sure
you didn't intend to give it to
someone else...?";"";"";
7bc3d;"Use that information well, Adol.";"";"";
7bc65;"Lilia's favorite flower is
the Marle Blossom.";"";"";
7bc99;"All right. Thank you very much!
In exchange for this lovely gift,
I'll let you in on a secret.";"";"";
7bcff;"Well, thank you very much!
I do so love getting presents.";"";"";
7bd3f;"After all...you might just
capture a heart or two!";"";"";
7bd79;"You'd probably be better served giving
these gifts to a girl, though, rather
than crusty old me.";"";"";
7bde1;"Uh, th-thank you. You know, you're
making me feel a little bad accepting
all these gifts from you!";"";"";
7be4b;"The only thing I have to offer is
my devotion...so there you have it.
I give my devotion to you!";"";"";
7beb3;"I wish I could give you
something in return.";"";"";
7bee7;"You are just too, too generous! As
repayment for your kind deeds, allow
me to tell you all about our nurse.";"";"";
7bf59;"...I just thought you
might like to know.";"";"";
7bf89;"She makes patchwork quilts for fun, and
loves spicy food, but hates sour things.
Oh, and she's single, as far as I know!";"";"";
7c009;"Her full name is Sarina Rune.";"";"";
7c02d;"Well...thank you for this, but...
fireballs? Really?! Where's your
common sense, man?!";"";"";
7c08b;"If you want to snag yourself a nice
girlfriend and settle down, fireballs
are NOT going to help your cause.";"";"";
7c0fd;"Oh, for me? Thank you. I accept
your apology. Now please, don't
set me on fire anymore, okay?";"";"";
7c161;"I'm meeeelting...MEEEEELTING!";"";"";
7c185;"I'll see you soon!
Best of luck!";"";"";
7c1ad;"As for the medicine...
Well, I assume you'll be okay
to continue the search, no?";"";"";
7c205;"I'll make use of
this right away!";"";"";
7c22d;"With this, I can fly right back
to Lance Village. Thank you so
much for the thoughtful gift!";"";"";
7c291;"Oh! It's...a Wing!";"";"";
7c2ab;"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";"";"";
7c30b;"The more times you defeat a
certain type of enemy, the
more you'll learn about it.";"";"";
7c365;"Once you drink it, you'll be able to
ascertain the strengths and weaknesses
of demons merely by striking them down.";"";"";
7c3df;"I'm not sure where it is, but medical
legends (yes, we have those) speak of
a tonic called a [#c2#Bestiary Potion#c#].";"";"";
7c45d;"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";"";"";
7c4bd;"If only there were a way to draw them
out into the open...but I'm afraid we
don't yet know how to bait a Roo.";"";"";
7c531;"They now live in seclusion, hiding
whenever humans draw near. You'll be
able to sense them, but not see them.";"";"";
7c5a5;"Supposedly, something happened to them,
giving them a demon-like appearance--
albeit a cute and fuzzy one.";"";"";
7c617;"There exist sacred animals in Ys known
as [Roos], which were once beloved by
the Goddesses and Priests.";"";"";
7c685;"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";"";"";
7c6e5;"Who knows? With the Transform
magic, you might just be able
to make friends with the Roos!";"";"";
7c747;"With it, you can take the form of a
demon, not only allowing for infil-
tration, but also communication.";"";"";
7c7b7;"One of the six magics of the
Priests is the spell of Wisdom,
better known as [Transform].";"";"";
7c817;"Oh, is this for me? Well, then,
allow me to give you some valuable
information in return!";"";"";
7c877;"I wonder if there are still fields
of those beautiful flowers down in
the world below...";"";"";
7c8d7;"The white Celcetas found on hillsides
bring love, while the blue moonlight
buds bring life.";"";"";
7c939;"Back when Ys was still part of the world
below, they bloomed everywhere. Whole
fields would be overrun with them.";"";"";
7c9b1;"As I'm sure you well know,
the Celceta Flower is quite
dear to us...";"";"";
7c9fd;"...You burned my award-winning
beard with that fire magic of
yours, you know.";"";"";
7ca51;"Since taste is mostly smell, all the
food I eat now tastes like burning
hair. Thanks a lot, pyro boy!";"";"";
7cabd;"Oh, for me? Well! Thank
you very much!";"";"";
7caeb;"I don't appreciate you hitting me with
that fireball, but as long as you're
careful from now on, all is forgiven.";"";"";
7cb63;"That's...#c2#Roda Fruit#c#!";"";"";
7cb85;"To have found such a rare item... Truly,
you must be blessed by the Goddesses for
all you've done in the name of Ys!";"";"";
7cc01;"My, my, you found it!";"";"";
7cc1d;"In other words, once we
have them both, we'll be
able to save her!";"";"";
7cc67;"If I can mix this with #c2#Roda Fruit#c#,
I'll have no trouble making that
#c2#medicine for Lilia#c#.";"";"";
7ccd3;"My beard! My beautiful beard!";"";"";
7ccf7;"Oh, it's for me? ...But, I don't
have anything to give in return!
Except...some information, perhaps?";"";"";
7cd63;"Oh yeah, and if you do find any
ore, don't forget to take it to
ol' Guido's shop!";"";"";
7cdbb;"If you have what it takes, you
ought to check it out sometime.";"";"";
7ce01;"The old Rasteenie Mine's got some demons
all right, but there are also medicinal
herbs to be found-- and iron ore, too!";"";"";
7ce7f;"Oh, it's for me? ...But, I don't
have anything to give in return!
Except...some information, perhaps?";"";"";
7ceeb;"And ol' Guido is the best there is at
refining iron, let me tell you. He'd
buy the ore off of you, for sure!";"";"";
7cf5f;"As you'd imagine, Iron Ore is really
valuable these days. Doesn't do a lick
of good, though, without refining.";"";"";
7cfd5;"This is starting to get a little
awkward, but thank you...I think!
In exchange, how about some information?";"";"";
7d047;"It'd be like attacking a ferocious bear
with a bird's feather, while garbed only
in choice cuts of delicious meat.";"";"";
7d0c1;"And only Cleria can block its attacks,
as well. Without a sword and armor made
of Cleria, you might as well give up!";"";"";
7d13d;"The legends say that the true source of
this world's evil is almost totally
invincible. Only Cleria can harm it.";"";"";
7d1b5;"This is starting to get a little
awkward, but thank you...I think!
In exchange, how about some information?";"";"";
7d227;"My deepest apologies to you.";"";"";
7d24b;"...That's what I'd say if I had any
information to give you. But I'm fresh
out, I'm afraid! My brain is empty!";"";"";
7d2c1;"...I'm beginning to wonder about you.
But thank you, nonetheless. I do have
one more piece of information for you...";"";"";
7d33d;"Wait... That's the robe, right there!
Is that why you've been smiling so
coyly these last three dialogue boxes?";"";"";
7d3b3;"Now, is that some obscure
information, or what?!";"";"";
7d3eb;"Those who wear it steadily receive
the blessings of those spirits,
recovering health bit by bit.";"";"";
7d453;"Supposedly, there's a type of robe
somewhere in Ys that's imbued with
the benevolent spirits of the dead.";"";"";
7d4c3;"Yes, yes, that's very nice, but
FIREBALL ring a bell?! Watch where
you aim those things, man!";"";"";
7d527;"Thanks. Here's a tip: Armor doesn't
do much against fireballs. You just
have to be careful not to get hit!";"";"";
7d599;"What, are you looking for armor
that deflects fire or something?
You COULD just TELL me...";"";"";
7d5fb;"What? You're giving this to me,
free of charge?! Thanks so much!";"";"";
7d643;"If you have the time to stop and pick
some apples, you should. They make
great gifts for people!";"";"";
7d6ab;"Oh, yes...just to let you know, in case
you don't already, there are apple trees
in the plains outside the village.";"";"";
7d725;"In all my years of trading, I've
never met someone as kind as you.
I'm deeply moved!";"";"";
7d781;"What, you're giving this to me
for nothing? Why, thank you!";"";"";
7d7c3;"The Shrine of Solomon is majestic, but
the view of the Ice Ridge is truly a
sight to behold. And so very romantic!";"";"";
7d83d;"You can get an absolutely incredible
view of the world around you from there,
as well as Ys itself.";"";"";
7d8a7;"I hate to bore you with idle chitchat,
sir, but have you tried walking a ways
out onto the plain, to the overlook?";"";"";
7d921;"Such kindness from a
customer makes me feel
proud of the work I do.";"";"";
7d96b;"Oh, you're giving
me this? Thanks!";"";"";
7d995;"If you butter him up a little,
he might share with you, too.
Worth a shot, no?";"";"";
7d9eb;"Mmmm... *licks fingers* He smokes
meat like an artisan of butchery.
I just had some, and it's MAGNIFICENT.";"";"";
7da5d;"So I'm sorry to change the
subject, but do you know the
pikkard-keeper, Theo?";"";"";
7dab1;"Such kindness from a
customer makes me feel
proud of the work I do.";"";"";
7dafb;"Now, look...";"";"";
7db0f;"There's a right place and a wrong
place for such things. You'd do
well to learn the difference.";"";"";
7db75;"What would happen to me if my
stock were to catch fire? Hmm?
You ever stop to think about that?";"";"";
7dbdb;"Well...all right. Water under the
bridge. Just don't you be shooting
fireballs at me again, okay?";"";"";
7dc43;"What the...?!";"";"";
7dc57;"Wh-what? ...For me? Really?!
No strings attached?";"";"";
7dc8f;"I see... I feel almost
embarrassed. But thank
you very much!";"";"";
7dcd3;"Oh, I can have this? Thanks!";"";"";
7dcf7;"With money, perhaps.
A lot of it, at that.";"";"";
7dd29;"I really can't give anything in return,
but if you were to bring me some Iron
Ore, maybe I could help you in some way.";"";"";
7dda7;"Oh, I can have this? Thanks!";"";"";
7ddcb;"And it feels so one-sided...
I'd like to give back, but I
just don't have anything suitable!";"";"";
7de2f;"I feel bad for taking from you like
this. You really shouldn't keep bringing
me gifts-- people will talk!";"";"";
7de9f;"While I do appreciate your kind gifts,
they do NOT give you the right to burn
up my shop. So cut it out, okay?";"";"";
7df15;"With this, I suppose I can
forgive you for shooting me
with fireballs. I suppose.";"";"";
7df6d;"Ouch! That smarts!";"";"";
7df87;"Huh? You're...giving me a gift?";"";"";
7dfad;"I shall graciously accept
your generous gift.";"";"";
7dfe1;"You know, I normally like my privacy.
Peace and quiet, and all that. But
thank you, nonetheless.";"";"";
7e049;"A gift? For me?";"";"";
7e05f;"...Well, if you're just giving it to
me out of the goodness of your heart,
then fine. I graciously accept.";"";"";
7e0d1;"I'll be fine! And besides, I don't see
a wife with you, either. Do you even
have a place to sleep?!";"";"";
7e13b;"Is it out of pity or something?
Do I seem sad and lonely to you?";"";"";
7e183;"Why did you come so far out
of your way to talk to me?";"";"";
7e1c1;"Man, you're just a fountain
of giving!";"";"";
7e1ef;"Fat chance! My solitude...
My peace and quiet...
Without them, I'm NOTHING!";"";"";
7e241;"Are you trying to make me all
complacent so I'll let you live
here with me or something?!";"";"";
7e2a1;"Well, thank you. I don't know
what your game is, but...
...Wait, are you...?";"";"";
7e2f5;"So I can have this...?";"";"";
7e313;"...Not that I'd...y'know...
be interested...in something
like that...with you...";"";"";
7e36b;"If you've got a crush on me or
something, you might as well just
come right out and say it!";"";"";
7e3cd;"Well, if that's what you want,
I guess I should accept. But I
must know: Why? Why me?";"";"";
7e429;"Another gift, huh?";"";"";
7e443;"...Fine. You can live here with me,
if you want. Just try to keep quiet!";"";"";
7e493;"...
Thanks.";"";"";
7e4a5;"Yeah, I'll take it...but can
I just tell you something?";"";"";
7e4e3;"I can't stand guys like you.";"";"";
7e507;"You think everyone should fawn
over you or something, just
because you can use magic?";"";"";
7e563;"Keep it down, dumbass!";"";"";
7e581;"Oh great, he's got FIRE now...";"";"";
7e5a7;"Oh, you're giving this
to me? Hmm? Oh, my, what
could this mean...?";"";"";
7e5f1;"Well, stand firm and stay
strong, swordsman. And thank
you again!";"";"";
7e639;"Still, it's better than just fumbling
about at random, wondering what to do
next...wouldn't you agree?";"";"";
7e6a7;"Plus, some people are ingrates.
They'll just take your gift, and
not tell you anything at all!";"";"";
7e70d;"Though we're a greedy lot. It's hard
to get useful information out of us
WITHOUT showering us in presents.";"";"";
7e77f;"If you ever get stuck, try giving
gifts to people. You never know
what they might tell you in return!";"";"";
7e7eb;"Well, the least I can do is
tell you something useful in
return, no?";"";"";
7e837;"This is for me? Hmm...
What could this mean?";"";"";
7e86b;"You might discover a newfound
purpose for items you previously
assumed to be useless!";"";"";
7e8c7;"If you're ever REALLY stuck, try
using all of the items at your
disposal, everywhere you go.";"";"";
7e92b;"Well, the least I can do is
tell you something useful in
return, no?";"";"";
7e977;"You're giving this to me?
Oh-ho... Whatever could this
mean, I wonder...?";"";"";
7e9c7;"That's really all I can come up with,
at this point. If you want to know
more, try giving stuff to other people!";"";"";
7ea3f;"They're going to start thinking
you're some kind of lady-killer!";"";"";
7ea87;"You're giving gifts to just about
every girl you see, aren't you? I
wouldn't press my luck, if I were you!";"";"";
7eaf9;"Interesting, interesting... Who ARE
you, Adol Christin? You're the complete
opposite of every other guy I've met!";"";"";
7eb71;"You need to act more mature, good sir.
The slightest misstep can start a nasty
wave of gossip, after all!";"";"";
7ebe1;"So...are you interested in me, then?
And if so, I must know, how do you
intend to break the news to Lilia?";"";"";
7ec53;"If you want me to have it, I'll take
it, gladly...but I have nothing else
to tell you, I'm afraid.";"";"";
7ecbd;"Again with the gifts?";"";"";
7ecd9;"I'll be looking forward to
seeing how this pans out,
Adol Christin.";"";"";
7ed23;"If you're still interested in me, I'll
be happy to court you then. If you even
remember me at that point, anyway!";"";"";
7ed9b;"Why don't you wait a while, and give
yourself some time to grow up...#w30#then
come back, and see what I think of you.";"";"";
7ee19;"You're a teenager, and teenage boys
looove to pine away for older women.
So I'm like...a trophy to you, right?";"";"";
7ee8f;"...I think I see what's
going on here!";"";"";
7eebd;"Since you won't stop playing with fire,
you leave me no choice. I'll not accept
your gift...but I WILL confiscate it!";"";"";
7ef39;"If you want me to forgive you, buy
me something more expensive, please.
I think you owe me that much.";"";"";
7efa5;"Your apology for playing with fire?
Are you trying to toy with me, boy?";"";"";
7eff3;"...Keep 'em coming. Enough gifts,
and I might start to think about
possibly forgiving you one day.";"";"";
7f05d;"You're giving this to me?";"";"";
7f07d;"Take it to him, please.";"";"";
7f09b;"I can't take this. Dr. Flair
needs it to make the #c2#medicine
for Lilia#c#!";"";"";
7f0ef;"Don't play with fire, son,
or you might get burned...";"";"";
7f12b;"A gift?! I-I don't know
what to say!";"";"";
7f157;"...I guess...thank you! I'll say thank
you, and accept, since you went to all
the trouble of getting it for me!";"";"";
7f1cd;"A gift?! I-I don't know
what to say!";"";"";
7f1f9;"Please, though, don't concern
yourself with me any further.
This is just too much!";"";"";
7f253;"...I guess...thank you! I'll say thank
you, and accept, since you went to all
the trouble of getting it for me!";"";"";
7f2c9;"Another gift? Oh, my... Adol,
you are just too much!";"";"";
7f305;"...And you know, Lilia has really
taken a shining to you lately. How,
uh...do you feel about her?";"";"";
7f36d;"But if it's that important
to you, I humbly accept!";"";"";
7f3a7;"Another gift? Oh, my... Adol,
you are just too much!";"";"";
7f3e3;"She really wants to be there
for you. You should...be there
for her, too.";"";"";
7f433;"Though lately, I must say, I've noticed
that Lilia is... Well, she's gotten
quite serious about you, Adol!";"";"";
7f4a5;"But if it's that important
to you, I humbly accept!";"";"";
7f4df;"Yet another one? Oh, my...";"";"";
7f501;"Or do you actually have feelings for
me? If you do...I must admit, I'm
genuinely flattered. But not interested!";"";"";
7f577;"I wonder if I'm not just serving
as a proxy for Lilia in your mind,
Adol Christin...";"";"";
7f5d3;"Adol, have you been doing this
for everyone in the village?";"";"";
7f615;"...The fireballs, I mean, not the
gifts. Though I'm curious about
that, as well!";"";"";
7f66d;"I shall humbly accept it, with my heart-
felt gratitude to you...on the condition
that you please STOP BURNING ME!";"";"";
7f6e7;"Sweet death has come for me...
and knows of my sins!";"";"";
7f723;"How very generous!";"";"";
7f73d;"If you continue on this path, I believe
everyone in the village will warm up to
you in no time at all!";"";"";
7f7ab;"To show such courtesy and discretion
in the house of our beloved elder...
You are truly an upstanding citizen!";"";"";
7f821;"Such generosity and thoughtfulness!";"";"";
7f84b;"If you keep this in mind, I'm
certain you'll find philanthropy
to be a truly rewarding hobby.";"";"";
7f8af;"Listen closely to what they tell you,
though, and you may learn something.
About them, if nothing else!";"";"";
7f91d;"But you shouldn't expect every person
to give back, of course. You must give
for the sake of giving!";"";"";
7f989;"Gifts are such wonderful things.
No one I know has ever disliked
receiving a gift!";"";"";
7f9e3;"Is that for me? Oh, my... Well, as a
token of my thanks, how about I tell
you a story about the Goddesses?";"";"";
7fa55;"Anyway, that's the gist of it. Twin
Goddesses who watch over Ys, like the
twin moons in the night sky.";"";"";

well. I will accept your gift.";"";"";

to get it open before...";"";"";

the Sanctuary of Toal.";"";"";

I told you about that, didn't I?";"";"";

Just don't shoot me again!";"";"";

that thing!";"";"";

Thanks!";"";"";

FIREBALLS?! ...Yeah, a dinky little
gift isn't gonna make up for that!";"";"";

Apology accepted.";"";"";

balls of fire!";"";"";

about those fireballs!";"";"";

you marry me? I don't wanna
wait till I'm older!";"";"";

And it'th ALL YOUR FAULT!";"";"";
81d4d;"You can't eat me! Don't try
to cook me!";"";"";
81d7b;"You gotta eat that, okay?
'Cauthe I gave it to you..";"";"";
81db7;"It'th my own thecret rethipe!";"";"";
81ddb;"You gotta eat it while it'th hot...
You wouldn't want to dithapoint me,
would you?";"";"";

latht meat pie I made for you!";"";"";
81e79;"Eep! That'th not nithe!";"";"";
81e97;"For me? I can't give you
anything in return! Are
you sure about this?";"";"";
81ee3;"For me? Hmmm... Well, okay!
I think I know just the thing
to give you in return, too!";"";"";
81f3f;"You should be overjoyed!";"";"";
81f5f;"Once she's grown up some more,
I'll let you marry my little
sister! How does that sound?";"";"";
81fbf;"For me? Hmmm... Well, okay.";"";"";
81fe1;"...Doesn't that just smell amazing?!";"";"";
8200d;"In return, how about some of the
best smoked meat I've made all year?
I'll let you have...#w30#a whiff of it!";"";"";
82081;"For me? Hmmmm... Well, you've been
really nice, so okay.";"";"";
820c1;"I'll give you some of my best smoked
meat in return. This is good stuff, I
promise! I'm an expert chef!";"";"";
8212f;"...I like to eat meat. And I like to
cook meat. But I don't like to BECOME
cooked meat. Understand?";"";"";
82199;"Is this for me? ...Well, okay. I
guess I can forget that nasty
fireball business.";"";"";
821f1;"Is this for me?";"";"";
82207;"...Wait, this is the meat I
gave YOU! Re-gifter, re-gifter!
Man, you're terrible!";"";"";
8225f;"Go on, savor the flavor!
I dare you NOT to love it!";"";"";
82299;"It won't go bad, don't worry.
I used a LOT of preservatives!";"";"";
822dd;"...Oh, hey, you still have some
from the last batch I cooked up.
Why haven't you eaten it yet?!";"";"";
82343;"This...looks like my
sister's cooking...";"";"";
82373;"You know, Lucy always said that
when she met her future husband,
she'd cook for him...";"";"";
823d1;"...Is it from Lucy?";"";"";
823eb;"Until then, go ahead and
enjoy her cooking. She's
surprisingly good!";"";"";
82437;"Well, she's a little too young
to marry you right now, but maybe
when she's older...";"";"";
82493;"Ah, so she proposed to you?
I see, I see.";"";"";
824c3;"Until then, go ahead and
enjoy her cooking. She's
surprisingly good!";"";"";
8250f;"Well, she's a little too young
to marry you right now, but maybe
when she's older...";"";"";
8256b;"Yes, yes, I heard you the
first time. Lucy wants to
marry you.";"";"";
825b1;"BARF!";"";"";
825bd;"Is this a gift for me, Adol?
That's so sweet of you! But...
I kind of feel bad for Lilia!";"";"";
8261d;"Is this a present
for me, Adol?";"";"";
82643;"...Or is that, perhaps, what
you're hoping for?";"";"";
82679;"Not that I'm complaining about all
the attention, but people will start
to talk if you keep this up...";"";"";
826e7;"Is this a present
for me, Adol?";"";"";
8270d;"Ohhh, what do I do? How do I
break this news to Lilia...?";"";"";
8274d;"Um... Are you, perhaps,
a bit sweet on me?";"";"";
8277f;"Is this a present
for me, Adol?";"";"";
827a5;"Give me some time to think
this over, okay?";"";"";
827d7;"Ohhh... How am I supposed
to choose between Lilia's
friendship and your love?";"";"";
8282b;"...Adol, you're really serious
about me, aren't you?";"";"";
82867;"Well, that clinches it. I have
to follow my heart. I want to be
with you, Adol Christin!";"";"";
828c7;"I'm just pulling your leg, of course. I
know that you and Lilia have something
special. I would never get in your way.";"";"";
82945;"...I'll bet you have this
problem with all the ladies
in your life, don't you?";"";"";
8299b;"But I think we should wait
before we get married...
I'm still much too young!";"";"";
829ef;"First you shoot me, then you
give me gifts... Is that any
way to treat a lady?";"";"";
82a45;"Really, Adol, I fear for Lilia
when I see you doing such violent
things. Fireballs, indeed!";"";"";
82aa7;"Stop! Don't! Get away!";"";"";
82ac5;"Thanks for the gift. You're
probably my twentieth best
friend in the world.";"";"";
82b17;"Thank you for the gift. Of all the
people in the world to whom I'm
indebted, you'd rank number six.";"";"";
82b81;"Thanks for the gift. You're the third
most godlike person I know.";"";"";
82bc9;"Thanks for the gift. Of all
the people I know, you're the
most...uhhh...";"";"";
82c19;"Hmmmm... What ARE you
the most of?";"";"";
82c43;"...Do you see me as an enemy?
Is that why you shot me with
a fireball?";"";"";
82c91;"I appreciate the gift, but I
still only regard you as a
casual acquaintance.";"";"";
82ce5;"Aieeee! This is the
seventh most painful
thing I've ever felt!";"";"";
82d2b;"Did you bring this just for me?! Well,
then it would be quite inconsiderate
of me if I didn't accept, no?";"";"";
82d9b;"I'd like to make friends with the Roos,
at the very least. They seem like a fun-
loving little race of cuties!";"";"";
82e11;"So, why do YOU think the demons attack
us? Is peaceful coexistence really such
an inconceivable concept?";"";"";
82e81;"Did you bring this just for me?! Well,
then it would be quite inconsiderate
of me if I didn't accept, no?";"";"";
82ef1;"I wish we could talk to them,
and get to know them...";"";"";
82f2d;"Do you think the demons ever
ask themselves that?";"";"";
82f65;"...So, why are we here, I wonder?
People, I mean. In this world.";"";"";
82fad;"Did you bring this just for me?! Well,
then it would be quite inconsiderate
of me if I didn't accept, no?";"";"";
8301d;"...It's because that's all they
know how to do! It's the only
behavior they've ever learned...";"";"";
83083;"By trying to put myself in their shoes--
so to speak-- I think I may finally have
come up with a viable answer.";"";"";
830f9;"For some time now, I've been
pondering the question: Why
do the demons attack us?";"";"";
83151;"Is this for me?";"";"";
83167;"I'm on to you, bub!";"";"";
83181;"...You like hearing people
scream? And you think you can
just gift your way out of it?";"";"";
831df;"Is this for me?";"";"";
831f5;"...At any rate, just be
more careful, all right?";"";"";
8322d;"...Didn't mean to hit me?!
You were aiming right for
me, you lying little...";"";"";
83281;"Well, I'll take it, but...
don't think this makes up
for those fireballs earlier!";"";"";
832d9;"You wanna dance,
little man?!";"";"";
832fd;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";"";"";
83351;"Something about him just chills me to
the bone! You should definitely keep
your distance, if you can...";"";"";
833bf;"Oh, I've been meaning to tell you... I
caught a glimpse of that man in black,
ordering around a whole bunch of demons.";"";"";
8343d;"Well, all right... Never look a
gift horse in the mouth, as
they say!";"";"";
83489;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";"";"";
834dd;"There's also another old man, Regg,
who studies all kinds of esoteric stuff.
But he's been pretty down lately.";"";"";
83553;"He's one of the most knowledgeable men
I've ever met. A real prodigy! If you
need answers, he'll have them, for sure.";"";"";
835cf;"Oh, yeah, been meaning to tell you...
There's a guy named Hadat in Ramia.
If you're in the area, look him up!";"";"";
83643;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";"";"";
83697;"She IS more of the tiny plains variety
than huge tracts of land...but she's
got a real nice, slender figure overall.";"";"";
83713;"She's about 5 feet 2 inches, and
weighs 105 pounds. But of course,
her measurements are a REAL secret!";"";"";
83781;"Want to know a little more
about her?";"";"";
837ad;"First off, did you know Flonne's
my cousin? Yep, she is! She's a
real beautiful lady too, isn't she?";"";"";
83819;"Well... It's working! Here, come a
little closer. I've got some infor-
mation you might appreciate!";"";"";
83883;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";"";"";
838d7;"What do you mean, 'is that it?'
What more do you want?! I certainly
don't know HIS measurements!";"";"";
8393f;"I mean, I know a little something about
Nash, I guess. He's the pikkard-keeper
here, and he's got a little sister.";"";"";
839b9;"But...I don't have anything
particularly special or fun
to share with you!";"";"";
83a0b;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";"";"";
83a5f;"Heh heh heh... Some women
are just unattainable. You
should remember that!";"";"";
83ab1;"Or maybe...you're trying to
sweep me off my feet?";"";"";
83ae9;"And just what do you think you're
doing? Are you trying to buy my
forgiveness or something?!";"";"";
83b4d;"I don't even want to see your
face right now. Get out of here,
you...you CAD!";"";"";
83ba1;"What's this supposed to be?
You trying to get on my good
side, or something?";"";"";
83bf5;"Well...it's not going
to work! Not after you
tried to burn me up!";"";"";
83c3d;"...I don't want it.";"";"";
83c57;"Yyyyeeeeaaaarrrrgggghhhh!!!!";"";"";
83c7b;"For me?";"";"";
83c89;"I graciously accept!";"";"";
83ca5;"Thanks!";"";"";
83cb3;"For me?";"";"";
83cc1;"You shouldn't have!
But you did...so thanks!";"";"";
83cf5;"Wow, thanks!";"";"";
83d09;"Eavesdropping is bad, though,
mmmkay? So don't do it! Even
if you can!";"";"";
83d57;"...What an item, huh?";"";"";
83d73;"Here's a tip: When you wear the #c2#Whisper
Earrings#c#, you can hear even the faintest
of sounds from insane distances.";"";"";
83df3;"Oh, thank you.";"";"";
83e09;"Heck, some even seem to have political
agendas! It's kind of fascinating-- when
they're not poised to kill you, anyway!";"";"";
83e87;"Some seem to be better
at following orders
than others.";"";"";
83ec5;"Here's a tip: There are many
different kinds of demons.";"";"";
83f03;"Oh, thank you.";"";"";
83f19;"Regg has quite the brain on him. Knows
anything and everything, it seems! He's
pretty much the go-to guy at Ramia.";"";"";
83f93;"So, have you been to Ramia yet? It's
really nice. Haven't been there in a
while, though. Wonder how Regg's doing!";"";"";
8400b;"Uh, hi, you BURNED me, remember?
You think a gift can make up for
that? Get lost, you creep!";"";"";
8406f;"*sigh* Thank you. I guess this is like
an apology, then? As long as you don't
do it again...then...apology accepted.";"";"";
840eb;"I'll pass, thanks.";"";"";
84105;"Searing pain?!
No thank you!";"";"";
84129;"Young people today are so polite.
Allow me to express my gratitude
by giving you a word of advice.";"";"";
84193;"You should always check to make
sure you unequip your magic before
going to sleep.";"";"";
841ed;"If it's the type that gradually drains
your magic power, you may wake up to
find it...all gone!";"";"";
84253;"If you should decide to take a
nap to clear your head, be wary
of the magic you have equipped!";"";"";
842b9;"More gifts? I'm afraid I don't
really have any more advice for
you, though...";"";"";
8430d;"If you should find it, be sure
not to use it unless and until
you absolutely need to.";"";"";
84369;"I've heard tell that there exists a
life-restoring 'Elixir' in Ys...but
only one single dose.";"";"";
843cd;"...Actually, there
WAS one thing...";"";"";
843f7;"But since you made the effort...
I'll graciously accept. Thank you.";"";"";
84441;"Well...it's a start.
Thank you.";"";"";
84467;"If you sincerely regret your
actions, then I will accept
this token of forgiveness.";"";"";
844c1;"...A gift? Well, I appreciate
the thought, but I have no
need of it. Sorry!";"";"";
84513;"If I clear my mind, it's
like a summer breeze...
with lots of pain.";"";"";
8455d;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
8457d;"Supposedly, the Priests made them in
order to help keep the demons out.
Pretty unbelievable, huh?";"";"";
845e5;"Hey, did you know? The lava pits around
this village were created 700 years ago,
when Ys was lifted into the sky.";"";"";
8465d;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
8467d;"Souvenirs are nice, but I'd rather
have you tell me all about your
adventures!";"";"";
846d3;"What's your secret? Are all
adventurers so level-headed?";"";"";
84713;"Mister Adol, you always seem so upbeat.
Even when the world's on your shoulders,
you're always happy and carefree!";"";"";
8478d;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
847ad;"Dunno where they live, but I'm sure
you've encountered some already, and
don't even know it!";"";"";
84811;"You should find the descendants of the
six Priests of Ys. I'll bet they've got
cool stuff they could give you!";"";"";
84887;"I wish I could give YOU something,
mister, but I'm just a kid. I don't
have anything you'd be able to use!";"";"";
848f9;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
84919;"The descendants of the Priests
probably do, though. They might
even know magic!";"";"";
8496f;"I wish I could give YOU something,
mister, but I'm just a kid. I don't
have anything you'd be able to use!";"";"";
849e1;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
84a01;"I dunno if he was serious or
not, but if he was, that is
SO INCREDIBLY AWESOME!";"";"";
84a57;"My dad was sayin' earlier that
he wondered if our ancestors
were related to the Priests.";"";"";
84ab7;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
84ad7;"Next time, though, if you shoot
a fireball at me, I'll reflect
it back at you. Pew! Pew!";"";"";
84b37;"For me? Heehee... Thanks!";"";"";
84b57;"Next time, though, if you shoot
a fireball at me, I'll bounce it
right back at your head! Sizzzzle!";"";"";
84bc1;"Owwieowwieowwie!";"";"";
84bd9;"This is for me? Oh, but I'm a
married woman... Are you sure?";"";"";
84c1d;"Well, they might have something to say,
though you won't be able to understand
them without being a demon yourself!";"";"";
84c97;"You say you want to talk to
the demons around here?";"";"";
84cd1;"Well, I do appreciate it...but
I can't help feeling as if you
possess an ulterior motive.";"";"";
84d31;"This is for me? Oh, but I'm a
married woman... Are you sure?";"";"";
84d75;"Not even the demons can traverse it
safely-- though they do, somehow. It
must be some manner of sorcery!";"";"";
84de5;"A word of advice, too: If you're going
to spend time in the lava pits, do take
heed, as one hall is full of poison gas.";"";"";
84e63;"Such a giving person, you are...
And yet I have nothing to give
back, aside from my thanks!";"";"";
84ec5;"For me? Is this an attempt at
reconciliation for your prior
fireball-related misdeeds?";"";"";
84f23;"Then...I shall forgive you.
For now.";"";"";
84f4f;"Oh, is this for me?";"";"";
84f69;"I do not approve, but I also
won't hold it against you.";"";"";
84fa7;"I presumed you my enemy, what with the
fireballs and all. I see now that you
simply have a warped sense of humor...";"";"";
85021;"I don't need it,
but thank you,
nonetheless.";"";"";
85055;"Vile fiend!";"";"";
85067;"A gift? Well, I can't just receive
without also giving! So how about I
give you some information on this area?";"";"";
850dd;"Before that, when Ys was back on the
surface, we flourished as a halfway
point to the Shrine of Solomon.";"";"";
8514d;"The lava's been bubbling
all around us for hundreds
of years, now...";"";"";
85199;"This village doesn't have any
special name. We just call it
the Colony of Lava.";"";"";
851ef;"A gift? Well, I can't just receive
without also giving! So how about I
give you some information on this area?";"";"";
85265;"Keep a cool, non-demonic,
unpoisoned head, and you'll
do just fine.";"";"";
852af;"Lava...demons...and the
poison gas corridor.";"";"";
852e3;"If you want to survive around here,
there are three things you should
steer clear of.";"";"";
8533f;"Hah. I've gotten used to living
around lava. No little fireball's
going to bother me!";"";"";
8539b;"If this is your way of atoning,
then I'll gladly accept it.";"";"";
853dd;"Still, that wasn't very nice.";"";"";
85401;"Hah. I've gotten used to living
around lava. No little fireball's
going to bother me!";"";"";
8545d;"Still, please be more careful
in the future, all right?";"";"";
8549b;"Doesn't hurt a bit!";"";"";
854b5;"What's this? You buttering me
up so I'll tell you everything
I know about the demons?";"";"";
85511;"Well, why don't you ask them yourself?
You might be able to understand them
if YOU were a demon, too...";"";"";
8557f;"What's this? You buttering me
up so I'll tell you everything
I know about the demons?";"";"";
855db;"They're different from demons. They're
smart, and apparently sacred animals.
If only I could talk to one of them...";"";"";
85655;"Well, here's a little tidbit for
you. There are some cute little
critters around here called 'Roos.'";"";"";
856c1;"Look... No. Just no.
Get the hell away from
me, you bipolar freak!";"";"";
8570b;"Hmph. I'll take it. But no
information for you. That's
what you get!";"";"";
85757;"I don't know what you're trying to do,
but I'm not obliged to take this.";"";"";
857a7;"How rude!";"";"";
857b7;"Oh my, is this for me?
Thank you very much!";"";"";
857e9;"My husband's going to be so
jealous...but that just makes
it more exciting! Tee hee...";"";"";
85847;"Oh my, is this for me?
Thank you very much!";"";"";
85879;"You don't need to make a fuss over
little old me, though! Your kind
feelings are gift enough.";"";"";
858dd;"My hair's all burned up!";"";"";
858fd;"A pox on thee, fire-starter!";"";"";
85921;"My furniture's all singed!";"";"";
85943;"*sigh* ...All right. I guess
I can't hold a grudge forever.
Let's just call it even.";"";"";
8599f;"Hmmm... I think I'll pass.";"";"";
859c1;"...Pay me no mind, please.";"";"";
859e3;"Hey! HEY! What the hell
do you think you're doing?!";"";"";
85a1d;"Thank you for your kindness. I'll
make sure the rest of the villagers
act a little nicer toward you.";"";"";
85a89;"Thank you for your kindness. It's a nice
gesture. My husband is...not the sort to
give gifts like this.";"";"";
85af7;"He's actually most well-known for
having his head in the clouds. Not
something to be proud of, that!";"";"";
85b63;"Harumph. Be careful with
that magic of yours, okay?";"";"";
85b9d;"Thank you for your kindness.
I believe this should cover
the damages, indeed.";"";"";
85bf1;"...Thank you, but I must
respectfully decline.";"";"";
85c27;"...Are you trying to
cheer me up?";"";"";
85c4f;"I'll have to decline. But I
honestly do appreciate the
thought, very much!";"";"";
85ca1;"I appreciate the sentiment, I really do.
But I can't accept a gift when poor Noit
is out there, all alone, in danger...";"";"";
85d1f;"Hey! Watch it!";"";"";
85d35;"You're very kind. They say one must
always respect his elders, and you
certainly are doing just that.";"";"";
85da1;"Invariably, the answers you seek
can be found in the tired old brain
of an octogenarian.";"";"";
85e01;"With age comes wisdom,
after all!";"";"";
85e29;"Every village is the same, in one
respect: If you want to know something,
you ask the old folks first.";"";"";
85e97;"You're very kind. They say one must
always respect his elders, and you
certainly are doing just that.";"";"";
85f03;"And sometimes, that's just as important
as what came before...but not usually!
The past is better. Objectively better!";"";"";
85f81;"They're sure to know what's
going on in the here and now.";"";"";
85fc1;"If you've talked to the old folks and
you're still not sure what to do, then
you might try the younger farmers next.";"";"";
8603d;"I can't believe you hit
me with fireballs!";"";"";
8606f;"Don't go thinking that this
means all's forgiven!";"";"";
860a7;"There's a special place in hell
reserved for those who abuse the
elderly with fire.";"";"";
86101;"I swear... What ever happened
to respecting one's elders?!";"";"";
86143;"Either way, thanks. At
least you're trying to
make amends...";"";"";
86187;"...I don't want that.";"";"";
861a3;"It burns! More than usual!";"";"";
861c5;"T'anks.";"";"";
861d3;"Many t'anks.";"";"";
861e7;"T'anks a lot!";"";"";
861fb;"You're a poopy-head!";"";"";
86217;"You're a jerk-face!";"";"";
86231;"Owww, it huuuurts!";"";"";
8624b;"Heh... You wouldn't just give me
a gift unless you thought you could
get something in return.";"";"";
862af;"Heh... You wouldn't just give me a gift
unless you thought you could get some-
thing in return. Well...";"";"";
8631d;"...I'm not about to introduce
you to my sister. Sorry!";"";"";
8635b;"Heh... You wouldn't just give me
a gift unless you thought you could
get something in return.";"";"";
863bf;"Elle would be FURIOUS
if she found out!";"";"";
863ed;"But don't tell anyone I
said that, okay?";"";"";
8641d;"Ehh, but they're both real sweet
girls. Sweet on YOU, I think!";"";"";
86463;"You planning on hitting up the women
next? I wouldn't recommend giving a
present to Flonne. Elle's a safer bet.";"";"";
864d9;"Come on, now, really? After
pelting me with fireballs?";"";"";
86517;"...Those fireballs really
hurt, you know.";"";"";
86547;"I don't want any gifts
from an outsider.";"";"";
86577;"Agh! Ack! Awoo!";"";"";
8658d;"Uh, okay. I mean, I guess it's
nice of you to do this, but it
seems a little awkward...";"";"";
865eb;"Thanks, though...I think.";"";"";
8660b;"We've all grown up in a pretty severe
environment, which makes for a close-
knit community.";"";"";
8666d;"Once we accept you as one of
our own, though...you'll see
what we're really like.";"";"";
866c5;"Generally speaking, outsiders
aren't...uh...welcome here.";"";"";
86705;"Make up your mind: Fire, or gift?";"";"";
8672d;"What a cruel, cruel man you are.";"";"";
86755;"Please, just leave me be.";"";"";
86775;"What the hell?!";"";"";
8678b;"Thank you...but what could I
possibly do for you in return?";"";"";
867cd;"My apologies. I hope I didn't get
your hopes up too high. I'm just
giving you the facts-- nothing more!";"";"";
8683b;"Unfortunately, where to FIND one
is a different story altogether!";"";"";
86883;"They provide immunity from poison when
placed over the mouth. Probably could
use one to get through the gas corridor.";"";"";
868ff;"Hmmm... Have you heard of
the Roda Tree? And do you
know of its leaves?";"";"";
8694d;"Thank you...but what could I
possibly do for you in return?";"";"";
8698f;"Thank you. I can't do much to help,
but at the least, please allow me
to pray for your safety.";"";"";
869f5;"You're just...#w10#an amazing
human being, Adol Christin.";"";"";
86a35;"I mean, not only are you saving
our land, but you're also giving
me gifts along the way!";"";"";
86a95;"...Thank you. You've made
me so very happy!";"";"";
86ac7;"Do your best, whatever may come.
I'll pray for your safety until
the very end.";"";"";
86b1d;"...But I know that our fate
rests with you. I can see it
in your eyes.";"";"";
86b6b;"I don't know the exact circumstances
of your fight...";"";"";
86ba7;"...Thank you so much. But...why
are you so kind to me?";"";"";
86be5;"I've just been so lonely...
...
#w16#...I-I mean...uhh, nothing! Th-thanks!";"";"";
86c37;"I have to admit, I don't have a lot of
faith in the kindness of strangers. Or
rather, I didn't...until you came along.";"";"";
86cb5;"Um... Just so you know, that magic
of yours? IT REALLY HURTS!";"";"";
86cf9;"A man of integrity, are you? Well,
then I'll accept your gift as an
apology for the fireballs. Thank you.";"";"";
86d69;"...How do I know about it? Oh, I was
chatting with Regg, from Ramia Village.
He talks about the strangest things!";"";"";
86de1;"If the demons get ahold of it,
there's no telling how much their
strength will increase.";"";"";
86e41;"Have you ever heard of the Black Pearl?
It's supposed to be the source of the
demons' power.";"";"";
86ea5;"I-I'm sorry. I...
can't accept this.";"";"";
86ed1;"Nooooo! It's high school
all over again!";"";"";
86f01;"Oh, my! Thank you so much!";"";"";
86f23;"Oh, my! Thank you so much!";"";"";
86f45;"...I think you did...
but I can't entirely
remember!";"";"";
86f81;"Hey, wait... You gave me a
gift before, didn't you?";"";"";
86fbb;"Oh, my! Thank you so much!";"";"";
86fdd;"...Oh, yes, I remember now!
30 years ago, wasn't it?";"";"";
87019;"Hey, wait... You gave me a
gift before, didn't you?";"";"";
87053;"I don't remember why I'm mad
at you, but this gift alone
won't make it better!";"";"";
870a9;"I don't quite remember why I'm
mad at you, but this gift alone
won't make it better!";"";"";
87105;"Ack! I will never forget
this horrible, horrible
sensation!";"";"";
87147;"Why, thank you! So,
what do you think of
our humble village?";"";"";
8718b;"It hasn't all been sunshine and flowers
here for us-- especially in a lava pit--
but, be it ever so humble, you know?";"";"";
87207;"Why, thank you!";"";"";
8721d;"...Though not from me. I've
got nothing, I'm afraid.";"";"";
87259;"Your good deeds shall surely
come back to you tenfold.";"";"";
87297;"Why, thank you!";"";"";
872ad;"You'd be best off with a woman who'd
love you as you are, embracing the
bad with the good.";"";"";
8730f;"You know, an older woman would be
a perfect match for a devoted young
man like yourself.";"";"";
8736f;"Thank you again!";"";"";
87387;"One who would forsake all others
to live out her days with you.";"";"";
873cd;"A hard-working man like you really
deserves an honest, earthy woman.";"";"";
87419;"Thank you again!";"";"";
87431;"May the road ahead be
blessed for you.";"";"";
8745f;"...I'd imagine that even women with
beauty rivaling that of the Goddesses
would be unable to resist your charms.";"";"";
874d7;"You're such a faithful man...";"";"";
874fb;"All right. All is forgiven, then.";"";"";
87523;"Neither a lender nor a borrower be. And
if it means my fiery demise...then a
gift receiver I be not, as well!";"";"";
87597;"Um... Thanks, but no thanks.";"";"";
875bb;"It's raw, so make sure you
don't let it get spoiled.";"";"";
875f7;"It's raw, so make sure you
don't let it get spoiled.";"";"";
87633;"...Oh? Seems you already
have some! Well, then I'll
just hang on to this...";"";"";
87685;"Oh, no. No, no, no...
This is not happening!";"";"";
876b9;"Hehh? This for me? Mighty nice of you!
Guess I shouldn't refuse the good will
of a friend...";"";"";
8771d;"...So thanks!";"";"";
87731;"You trying to get into my
good graces or somethin'?";"";"";
8776b;"Well, I accept. Thanks!";"";"";
87789;"...";"";"";
87793;"Thanks!";"";"";
877a1;"...Ehh, probably shouldn't act so
suspicious. Okay, I'll accept it.";"";"";
877eb;"What, you have a favor to ask
or something? You tryin' to
butter me up?!";"";"";
8783b;"Wait no. 4";"";"";
8784d;"Wait no. 5";"";"";
8785f;"What, the fireball thing?
Fireproof muscles, man.
Didn't feel a thing!";"";"";
878ad;"Now THAT'S a pick-me-up...";"";"";
878cf;"...";"";"";
878d9;"...";"";"";
878e3;"...What do you think you're doing?";"";"";
8790d;"...This will do nothing to
help your cause. You know
that, right?";"";"";
87955;"...";"";"";
8795f;"Fire...";"";"";
8796d;"You're giving this...to me?
Thanks very much.";"";"";
879a1;"Very well. I'll give you something
in return. Accept it with my graces.";"";"";
879ef;"Even if we're not enemies, though,
is it not a bit unusual to bestow
gifts upon a demon?";"";"";
87a4f;"You're giving this to me? Much obliged.
You're a kind young man. Savor these
experiences while you can.";"";"";
87abd;"Always remember that you have a
long life ahead of you. Don't cut
it short by taking stupid risks.";"";"";
87b27;"This battle will require more
of you than simply slaughtering
every enemy in sight.";"";"";
87b81;"If you're ever unsure of what to
do next, try asking around.";"";"";
87bc5;"Let me offer you a
word of advice.";"";"";
87bef;"(...If my sister were alive,
she'd be around your age...)";"";"";
87c2f;"A gift? Again? ...Thank you.
You're quite a strange one,
you know.";"";"";
87c79;"I, too, will lend you my assistance
whenever and however I can. So please
do not hesitate to call upon me.";"";"";
87ceb;"The hopes of many people rest
on your shoulders, but you do
not bear the burden alone.";"";"";
87d49;"Just remember one thing:
You are NOT alone in this
struggle.";"";"";
87d8d;"Despite my appearance, I am on your
side. But no other demon can claim
that. So be careful who you approach.";"";"";
87e01;"A present? I suppose this is to make up
for the fireball? Have you realized,
then, that I'm not your enemy?";"";"";
87e73;"As long as you know now,
I will consider the matter
resolved.";"";"";
87eb7;"A present? I suppose this is to make up
for the fireball? You DO know I'm not
your enemy, right?";"";"";
87f1f;"I do not wish to die from a fireball
thrown by an ally. So please, in the
future, I'd ask that you take more care.";"";"";
87f99;"Stop! I'm not your enemy!";"";"";
87fb9;"For me...?
Thank you.";"";"";
87fd5;"Quickly, the final battle
awaits. I'll be fine;
you go on ahead.";"";"";
8801d;"I'm afraid that all I can do in return,
though, is have faith in you, and pray
for ultimate victory...";"";"";
8808b;"For me...?
Thank you.";"";"";
880a7;"I'm sure a great many people
have you in their thoughts,
Adol Christin.";"";"";
880f5;"Please, make sure you take care
of yourself out there.";"";"";
88133;"I have no way I can ever repay you,
but I am truly grateful.";"";"";
88177;"You don't even know me, yet
you risked life and limb for
my sake. And now you give!";"";"";
881d1;"I cannot fathom why you'd bring me gifts
even after coming all the way to the
bell tower to rescue me...";"";"";
88241;"For me...? Thank you. I do
feel rather bad accepting so
many gifts from you, though.";"";"";
8829d;"And no matter what, I will pray
for your health and success, Adol.";"";"";
882e7;"...I'm engaged, so I'm afraid I
cannot return your affections.
You flatter me, though!";"";"";
88345;"Could it be that...you're
interested in me, perhaps?";"";"";
88381;"For me...?";"";"";
88393;"(At least he's making an
effort to atone...)";"";"";
883c7;"Thank you. This makes me very happy...
Almost happy enough to forget the pain
from my burns.";"";"";
8842b;"For me...?";"";"";
8843d;"(Maybe I'm being a bit hard on him.
He is trying to make up for his
mistakes, after all...)";"";"";
8849f;"Thank you. This makes me very happy...
I only wish I could feel the sensation
of it in my hand, through the burns...";"";"";
8851b;"A divine light enveloped
Adol, curing his wounds.";"";"";
88553;"Quickly, the final battle awaits.
Worry not about me. Your destiny
lies ahead.";"";"";
885a9;"Am I to be a sacrifice to
the fire in your heart?";"";"";
885e1;"Thank you, Adol.";"";"";
885f9;"The final battle is at hand.
Stand firm, Adol.";"";"";
8862f;"I have faith that when all is said and
done, this world will finally know true
peace. No more demons or monsters...";"";"";
886a9;"Today marks the end of our
seven hundred year ordeal.";"";"";
886e5;"So, have you equipped the
Cleria Shield I gave you?
Don't forget, now!";"";"";
88733;"Thank you, Adol. Please don't feel
obligated, though. It was my duty
to bring you the Cleria Shield.";"";"";
8879f;"Save your gifts. Give them to Feena
after the battle ends. Right now,
you need to stay focused!";"";"";
88805;"And compared to all that you've done
for us, it seems almost silly!";"";"";
8884f;"Thank you, Adol.";"";"";
88867;"Though I must admit, that
fireball was uncalled for...";"";"";
888a5;"Thank you, Adol.";"";"";
888bd;"I certainly didn't sleepwalk to Ys
to bring you the Cleria Shield, I'll
tell you that!";"";"";
8891b;"But don't you think there are nicer ways
of getting one's attention? Or did you
just want to make sure I was awake...?";"";"";
88999;"Ow... That really hurts!";"";"";
889b9;"Huh? For me?! Uh, thanks, but
shouldn't you be focused on the
battle at hand?";"";"";
88a0d;"Get to it, Adol!
We believe in you!";"";"";
88a37;"Without it, you'll be in for a
very short battle indeed.";"";"";
88a77;"If not, then I recommend you go
talk to him right away!";"";"";
88ab5;"Which reminds me, did you get the
Cleria Shield from Luta?";"";"";
88af7;"Hey, now! This is no time to
stand around handing out gifts!";"";"";
88b3b;"Do us proud, man!";"";"";
88b53;"Last but not least, don't forget
to prepare your Shield magic.";"";"";
88b99;"Do you have all of the Cleria
equipment? You should also equip
the Goddesses' Ring and an Elixir.";"";"";
88c01;"I appreciate the thought, I really do,
but you need to get ready to take down
that demon!";"";"";
88c61;"What does this look like, a baby
shower? Get that gift-bearing ass
of yours to the final boss already!";"";"";
88ccf;"Don't mess up, Adol!
Do us proud!";"";"";
88cf7;"...What, you want some words of wisdom?
